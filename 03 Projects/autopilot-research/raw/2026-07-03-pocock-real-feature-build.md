4. **Write-a-PRD skill** — Q&A co-location as attention hotspot; sketches modules first; asks which modules need tests; PRD → GitHub issue
5. **PRD-to-issues** — right-sized issues with blocking relationships; human merges too-small slices (6 → 4)
6. **Sandcastle (provisional) AFK harness** — Dockerfile + mounted workdir + Claude in container; commits patched out and applied locally; `pnpm ralph`, max 100 iterations; closes issues as it commits; tests+types every commit
7. **QA plan** — "take the last five commits and create a QA plan" as GitHub issue ("haven't come up with a skill for this yet"); AFK vs human-in-the-loop labels
8. **Feedback button** — in-app button files GitHub issues (AI title + route + dictation) → Ralph fixes in background while human QAs (day shift / night shift, attrib. "my friend Jaman on Twitter")

## Cleaned transcript

I've been posting a lot recently about
things you should do with Claude code
and mostly I've been approaching it from
the kind of philosophy angle. In other
words, kind of everyone's thinking this
is a new paradigm shift, but actually
just the stuff we've been doing for 20
years is really, really good with Claude
code. You get the most out of it when
you treat it like someone you would
delegate to in your team. In other
words, you focus on the architecture,
you focus on making sure that you've got
good feedback loops, you focus on all
the things we've been doing for the last
20 years, not planning too much up
front, all that stuff. And in all the
comments, people have been saying, "Show
us something practical. Show Show us you
doing it." And so this is that video. I
have no idea how long this video is
going to be. I have no idea exactly what
we're going to cover. I'm just going to
go into actually doing some work with
Claude code in my work repo and I'm
going to talk you through it. I'm going
to show you all of the skills I'm using,
I'm going to show you my process, and
we're just going to give you all the
context you can on how these tools are
actually used. And if you dig this, then
I'm running a cohort in a couple of
weeks for Claude code for real
engineers. It is 40% off this week and
it teaches you either teaches you the
skills that you need to do real
engineering or it gives you the
conversion course you need to take the
existing skills you have and apply them
to this new age. So if that sounds good
to you, then the link is below. Okay,
let's start by understanding the project
that I'm in and what point it is in in
its life cycle, all that stuff. This is
my course video manager. It's It's
about, you know, 1,200 commit. I've
closed around what, 637
issues on this project. And what I'm
using this for is this is my main kind
of entry point for anything I do
regarding creating content. In other
words, I create videos on here. I
organize my courses on here. I post
videos on here. I do thumbnail editing
on here. I do writing on here. It really
is my one-stop shop for everything I
need to do my job and it's amazing. In
terms of the code, it's a React router
application which uses TypeScript and
Node and uses drizzle for the database
ORM, use Postgres as its database, does
some a lot of testing with V test. And
the way I run this is I don't actually
deploy it, I just basically run it
locally. So, I just tend to run start. I
build it and I'm just, you know, run it
with the start script. This is a
confusing video for me to make because
actually right now I'm recording the
video that I'm making on the course
video manager. Here you go, this is me,
this is the clips that are being
detected from the video that I'm
recording and there you go, that's the
previous clip. This is a confusing video
to me to make, you know what I mean?
This is just got loads of stuff here.
This is what the main view looks like.
We've got courses down the left-hand
side here, then we've got lessons and
sections within those courses. And the
stuff I want to show you is inside the
free videos over here. Inside the app
I've got a concept of ghost lessons and
real lessons, which you can see on the
filters here. These ghost lessons
basically don't exist on disk and I need
to right-click the lesson and say create
on disk to actually create the lesson
in like a repo in the disk. And the
logic for this is fairly complicated
because I can turn this back into a
ghost here. So, and then when I do, I
need to delete all of the files that are
on the file system, convert it back to a
ghost. The idea here is that it lets me
plan and kind of create courses in the
same UI, which ends up being really,
really nice. But the thing I want to add
are some enhancements here. So, I want
to be able to when I create a lesson, I
shouldn't just need to create a ghost, I
should be able to add a real lesson
instead of a ghost lesson. Same when I
delete a real lesson, I should be able
to just delete it instead of needing to
turn it into a ghost first. So, this one
here. Now, this part of the code base is
really well tested and so this should be
a relatively simple build. But there is
another thing I want to do as well,
which is I want to when we go up to
these courses up here and add a new
course, I want to be able to basically
create a ghost course, a course that
doesn't yet exist on the file system
because currently every course needs an
entry in the file system. So, that is my
idea. I've got a very loose set of
requirements here, and this is maybe how
you enter most days as a developer. You
have some small tweaks that you need to
make to your application that are based
on some vague ideas. Maybe those are
ideas that you've come up with. Maybe
those are ideas that have come from
somewhere else. And the first thing you
need to do is actually road test those
ideas and harden those ideas. But, the
first thing we're going to do is open
this up in VS Code, and we're going to
um go into this and say "Grill me." I'm
going to use my dictation tool to
dictate some stuff into here. The way
that we handle ghosts in real lessons is
a little bit cumbersome in places. It's
annoying that you have to create a ghost
lesson before you then create a real
lesson. And it's also annoying that when
you delete it or delete a real lesson,
you can't just delete the real lesson.
You have to turn it into a ghost lesson
first. Now, at this point, I'm thinking,
"Do I also in this session want to
tackle the other thing? Do I want to
tackle the idea of ghost courses as
well?" My decision space for that is
like, "Will this crowd out the grill me
session, or will it all actually fairly
seamlessly link together?" Because the
idea of this grill me session is I'm
going to create a document out of this
that I'm then going to use to um
do future builds on, basically. So,
that's my decision here is, "Do I want
to create a PRD, a product requirements
document that has both of these things
in, or are these separate concerns that
I need to separate into separate PRDs?"
I'm going to say that this stuff
actually sort of belongs together. But,
I'm just making that decision kind of
arbitrarily really. I also want to
extend the courses functionality so that
it allows me to create a course without
having a file path. This would be a kind
of ghost course, a planned course that I
haven't actually decided whether I'm
going to build yet. Now, this second
section here, I haven't really explained
the why. That's something that's on my
mind now. I've sort of like I've
explained what I want the feature to do,
but I haven't explained why I want the
feature to exist. It's always really
important when you enter these sessions
that you explain the why to the LLM
because
sure, if the LLM has the what, then it
understands what you want to build, but
if it doesn't know the why, then it
can't suggest alternatives. The reason I
want this is so that I can plan courses
freely without needing to commit to an
exact shape on the file system.
Initiating new repositories is kind of
cumbersome, and I sometimes just like to
prefer or I prefer building stuff in
empty space instead of having to commit
to an actual shape. Ghost courses would
have slightly different constraints on
them. Ghost courses would likely have to
No, I guess ghost courses could have
real lessons. It's just the moment that
they have a real lesson inside them,
then they become a real course, and
you're then required to put it in the
file system, I guess. Or I don't know,
I'm not sure about that flow. Maybe we
can work on that together. Notice how
rough this is. This is just a super
hashed-out sort of idea that I'm kind of
you know, just spewing out the LLM and
making it do all the work. If you've not
seen my Grill Me skill, then head to my
I'll I'll send it in a link below. It's
in my top five skills article. But
you'll be able to see what it does. Here
it is. Really, really cool. Okay, it's
going to do an explore phase. I'm going
to
head and get a glass of water. And by
the way, if you don't know what explore
is, explore is it's basically invoking a
sub-agent. So it's essentially just
passing a message to another agent to
say explore this codebase. That agent
then
explores it within its own context
window, and then it takes that context
it takes a sort of summary of that, and
it hands it back to the parent agent. So
it allows you to get a lot of juice out
of an explore phase because the explore
can just go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,
read tons and tons of files, and then
the parent agent only gets a summary of
it. So it's very token efficient. But
anyway, I need a glass of water. Okay,
Grill Me has come back with a let me
challenge your framing of the current
pain points. It says that looking at the
code delete lesson in in course right
service already handles both ghost and
real lessons directly. If it's real, it
deletes the directory and renumbers. If
it's ghost, it just removes the DB row.
So, you can delete a real lesson without
converting to ghost first. Is there
something in the UI that forces the
convert to ghost then delete flow? Well,
yeah, there is. Yeah, in the UI there's
no option to delete the lesson
immediately. And
what I mean by deleting a real lesson is
it would both delete the entry from the
database and um purge the on-disk
representation. I'll ping this off while
I explain something very cool that I've
just recently started doing. I've been
reading a book called um
domain-driven design. And in this book,
they talk about how important it is that
you maintain a sense of a sort of
glossary of all of the terms that you
use to describe the system. This
ubiquitous language can then be used
basically to um bridge the gap between
uh devs and domain experts, the thing
the people you're actually building it
for. So, I love this because this is
exactly what the LLM has to have with
me. I'm the domain expert and the LLM is
the dev. And we need some kind of shared
language so that we can talk together
precisely. So, for instance, here we
have a concept of a ghost lesson, a
lesson that exists on whoopsie, a lesson
that exists on the database. Where is
it? Yeah, a lesson that exists on the
database but not yet on the file system.
And so, whenever the LLM is searching
for stuff about ghost lessons, it's
going to come up come across this
ubiquitous language file. Okay, so it
has come back and it said, "Yeah, the UI
currently only exposes convert to ghost
for real lessons, not a direct delete
entirely option. That's a
straightforward UI gap." Okay, that's
useful. Let's quickly talk about like
the way it's using service here and um
what this actually means in my code
base. I might actually try the new um by
the way side question thing here. This
is really useful when you just want to
ask a quick question and you don't want
it to kind of enter into the chat
history. Describe what's going on with
the course right service. uh describe
the shape of it, describe its
capabilities. Let's see what it comes
back with here. The reason I'm uh asking
about this and want to show you what it
is is that um I'm really proud of the
way that I've designed this repo. I
mean, there's definitely stuff in there
that definitely needs to be um looked
at, but the way I've done this service,
I think is quite nice. And the course
right service is the main business logic
layer for mutating course data, the
right side of the system. It coordinates
between the database, the file system,
and the path numbering and renumbering
logic. It's got a really clear interface
here, like you can add ghost lessons,
you can materialize a ghost, so convert
a ghost lesson to a real lesson, uh
convert it to ghost again, uh delete
lesson, etc. So, this is a big, big blob
of functionality. And the tests for this
course right service are all in one
place. So, course right service.test.ts.
Oh, no, okay, it used to be there, not
anymore. Yeah, here they are, course
right e2e.test.ts.
And this actually creates a test
database, it sets up a temporary Git
repo, and so it tests all of the
synchronization between this. This repo
is using effect, and effect makes it so,
so nice to create these kind of like
units within your system that you can
test really easily. Other languages have
this as a first-class thing, but effect
um sort of bolts that on on top of
TypeScript in a really beautiful way.
I've made a video about effect before on
this channel, just one video, and uh
suffice to say I still love it, and I
use it for literally everything. Or at
least every back end thing that I build
is all in effect. Anyway, this huge
service, the course right service, uh
where is it? DB function service, here
it is, the course right service. It just
lives in here. So, it's a file with
essentially a bunch of methods inside
here, and these methods, like
materialize ghost, like add ghost
section, add ghost lesson, delete
lesson, etc. This is what we're talking
about when we talk about this service.
So, then I can exit out of this by the
way thing by just pressing space, enter,
or escape, and now I'm back here. So,
this is a great question. What flow do
you actually want here? Are you saying
you want to create a lesson action that
immediately creates the directory on
disk, skipping the go step entirely? Or
is the pain more that the two-step
process, create ghost and then
materialize, feels like unnecessary
ceremony when you already know you want
a real lesson? Yes, exactly, the
two-step process feels unnecessary. And
it says, "Okay, so you want a single
create lesson action that creates both
the DB entity and the on-disk directory
in one shot when you already know that
it's going to be real." Yep. Okay, and
now it's gone to the bigger topic, ghost
courses. Yeah, here we go. Then you said
something interesting and immediately
hedged on it. Ghost courses could have
real lessons, and when they do, they
become a real course and you're required
to put it in the file system. Let me
break this apart. First question, a
ghost course has no file path, so it has
no Git repo. Sections and lessons inside
it would all be ghost by necessity.
There's no way to put them on disk. When
you say a ghost course could have real
lessons, what does real mean without a
file system? Right, so here what it's
doing is it's fleshing out my kind of
woolly language a little bit and forcing
me to be a bit more specific. This is an
easy question for me to answer. I don't
want them to have some kind of
intermediate status, like flesh more
fleshed out than a ghost. What a great
phrase. But yeah, A is pretty obviously
the thing here. Adding a real lesson to
a ghost course is the trigger that
forces you to assign a file path and
materialize the course. Now, I'm already
thinking from a UI point of view, what's
going to be the easier thing to do, or
rather the most obvious thing for the
user, the cleanest UI? Either when we
create a like real lesson inside a ghost
course, we basically say, "No, you can't
do that. to choose a thing in disk
first, and then you need to click away."
Or we create a kind of integrated flow
where you say, "Okay, you're writing
this to disk. When you do that for the
first time inside a ghost course, you
need to choose a place that it's going
to live." I think I'm like veering
towards the second because it's not that
complicated to do that in terms of UI,
and
I think it'll would a nicer flow. So,
let's say that to it. Yeah, we're going
to choose A here um and I think it makes
sense that when you press um convert to
or convert reveal in file system or
whatever the button is, whenever you
make it and material
Notice here, this is where the
ubiquitous language comes in really
handy because I was just sort of
fluffing around there, but what I mean
is that when I materialize a ghost
lesson, when you materialize a ghost
lesson, you should have a modal pop-up
that forces you to materialize the
course as well. Look how clean like how
much cleaner that language is because
I've got a concept of materializing and
the word agreed on between me and the
LLM. Anyway, let's fire this off and see
what happens. Right, yeah, we've got a
concept of um versions inside the
application, so course versions. This is
really important for me because I have a
team of people who actually apply the
course to the CMS and so I have a course
and a change log. For instance, here in
my Claude Code Cohort, I've got several
versions here and
like the sooner I approach the cohort,
the more I'm sort of fixing bugs or like
um switching out videos, that kind of
thing. The latest version is always the
draft version and then I can like
publish that draft version and add a
commit message to it and it goes into
the change log. Here you go, this is the
UI for publishing the new version and
here's a preview of the change log. So,
yeah, I'm pretty sure that the schema
that we rely on needs the ghost course
to still have versions. Yeah, I'm fairly
sure that the schema that we need um
will require us to have versions because
versions are needed in order to have
sections and lessons and stuff inside
them. However, it makes zero sense to be
able to publish a ghost version, so we
should just hide the bits of UI that's
um and the actions in the menu that
allow you to publish. So, let's fire
this off. I can see in my video editor
that we're about like 15 minutes in and
just notice like how long we're spending
here on fleshing out these ideas. The
more we do here, the less we're going to
end up needing to do
when we actually guide the LLM. Okay,
let me push on the file assignment
moments. When you materialize a ghost
course cuz you're materializing a lesson
inside of it, you need to give it a file
path. Either the repo already exists or
the repo doesn't exist yet. When you
assign a file path to a ghost course,
should the app handle repo creation for
you? No, it shouldn't handle repo
creation. It's just pointing at an
existing directory. That's an easy one
to figure out there. Okay, this is such
a lovely smart question that it's given
us here. It's laying out what you're
asking for. Direct delete for real
lessons, direct create for real lessons,
ghost courses, and then materializing a
lesson in ghost courses. Question, does
direct create apply inside ghost
courses, too? That's so freaking smart.
That's such a nice question. I can
imagine my old boss, Willow Reagan,
asking that question, who is the guy I
learned a lot of this lead developer
stuff from. He had this incredible
ability to just basically sit in a
meeting and ask smart questions for
hours and hours and hours. And this is
exactly what the AI is doing here. It's
asking really smart questions at the
right point in the process. So, if
you're inside a ghost course and you hit
create lesson, should that immediately
trigger the assigned file path modal and
create it on disk? Now, again, there's a
trade-off here, and instead of me
thinking about this in my own head,
which is not particularly fun viewing,
why don't we model what it might look
like if I sort of work this through with
the LLM? Can you give me the trade-offs
of both of these approaches? Okay, so
it's saying on option A, create lesson
inside a ghost course always creates a
ghost ghost lesson. Keeps the ghost
course as a pure planning space. The
assigned file path moment only happens
when you explicitly choose to
materialize, which is a clear deliberate
action. There's downside if you've
already decided this course is real and
you're just adding lessons, you're back
to the two-step annoyance you're trying
to fix. Option B, create lesson inside a
ghost course triggers the
materialization cascade. Yeah, it's
saying option A is the obvious choice
given your stated goal. The two-step
annoyance you described is specifically
about real courses where the file system
exists and you want a real lesson. Yeah,
I probably agree with it. If we want a
consistent UI, then we do want the
ability to both create real lessons and
create ghost lessons
at whatever stage the course is at,
whether it's real or ghost. That will
mean a bit less work in the front end
because we don't want to or won't need
to conditionally show things. Blah blah
blah blah blah. Yes, this makes sense to
me. Option A sounds good. I think it
mostly makes sense in the context of
having
two buttons, one to create a real lesson
and one to create a ghost lesson. Could
you just talk me through the UI a little
bit and how this is going to look?
Notice that I'm driving this a little
bit more now. That's okay, too. The
is nice and flexible so that you can
drive sometimes and the AI can drive.
This is nice, too. It's actually
checking the current UI for lesson
creation first. This is part of the
skill is I get it to, instead of asking
me questions about everything, if it's a
question that can only be answered by or
can be answered by looking at the code,
it should look at the code first. I do
wish that explore was faster. Explore is
the thing that's like, you need it in
every single session, sometimes multiple
times a session, and I just wish it was
quicker. Okay, so here's how the current
UI works. You right-click a section
header, you add a lesson, right-click an
existing lesson, add lesson before, add
lesson after, also creates a ghost.
Inside a real course, you right-click a
section, you'd see add ghost lesson and
add lesson. Inside a ghost course,
right-click a section, you'd only see
add ghost lesson. Yeah, right. That's
the question. Inside a ghost course, do
you want the create real lesson button
to exist at all? Now, at this point, I
don't know. Like, I'm imagining this UI
is going to get pretty crowded with this
like, cuz you're going to have multiple
buttons there. You're going to have
like, add a lesson
before this one, and then do you make it
ghost or real?
I guess like, oh man, this is actually
quite gnarly. I'm thinking, do I
actually want a prototype of this so I
can sort of see how it looks? Because
there's multiple ways that we could
fiddle with this and and get it like,
nice. You could have it where you add a
lesson, then it opens a modal, and you
whether um
it's a ghost lesson or a real lesson. I
think probably what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to build it one way and
then maybe offer feedback afterwards.
So, let's say yes, inside a ghost course
let's have the create real lesson
button. You know, I could like stop this
whole grilling session. I could go into
prototyping mode here where I just sort
of prototype, you know, three different
versions, five different versions of
this just to see what the UI would look
like, but I'm quite keen to get into
implementation now. Okay, so create real
lesson inside a ghost course triggers
the full cascade. Modal asks for file
path, course becomes real, section
materializes, lesson gets created on on
disk, all in one flow. That's right.
That modal is doing a lot of work.
Correct. It needs to grab the lesson
title and the course file path. Yeah,
that's it. Correct. That's it. We just
need the lesson title and the course
file path. That's it. I can feel it.
We're getting to the end of this
grilling session. Oh, maybe not.
It's asking about section behavior,
sections inside ghost courses, and the
state of a section is basically just
derived from um
the lesson. If there were any ghost
lessons inside a section, then it's
going to be a ghost. Oh, sorry. If there
are any real lessons inside a section,
then it's a real section on disk. A
section basically looks like this. It's
just essentially a directory on disk.
You can rename it and rename the
directory or you can add things to it,
but that's basically it. Section logic
should obey the current rules that we
already have. There's nothing really new
about sections. For instance, when we're
inside a ghost course and we create a
real lesson inside that section, then we
basically flow all the way up so it
becomes a real section, becomes a real
lesson, and becomes a real course. Here
we go. Let's keep going. Let me switch
to the database schema. Right now,
courses table has a file path as a
required text field. For ghost courses,
this would need to be nullable. That is
the only schema change I'm envisioning.
Yeah, just going to say yes to this.
It's going to grill me on a tricky edge
case. I see. Have a real course with a
file path. It has some real lessons and
some ghost lessons. You delete all the
real lessons or convert them all to
ghost, does the real course become a
ghost course? Again, this is like a
classic Willow Reagan question. It's
fantastic, really, really good. No, the
real course does not become a ghost
course. Once a course has a file path,
it stays real forever because the thing
that's on disk is not going anywhere.
Yeah, I was thinking about that before
and so I'm super glad that it answered
it because now it's in the context and
it's spelled out. Another edge case, you
have a ghost course, you materialize a
lesson, you assign a file path,
everything becomes real. Now the course
has a file path but no real lessons. I
feel like we just answered that, right?
That's a weird one. I mean, I don't
think Willow Reagan would ask that
question. Yeah, let me move to the
deletion side. You want to direct delete
action for real lessons in the UI.
Currently, the context menu for real
lessons shows convert to ghost but no
delete. Yeah, this is a UI thing. Should
real lessons have both options, convert
to ghost and delete?
I think we need
both. Okay, we're getting there, we're
getting there. I think I've covered the
main branches. Let me lay out the full
scope as I understand it and you tell me
if I'm missing anything. Courses file
path becomes nullable, ghost course
creation, a new course creation flow
that only asks for a name, no file path,
correct. Ghost course UI, hide the
publish and export actions, correct.
Create a real lesson button available in
both real and ghost courses. In a real
course, creates on disk immediately. In
a ghost course, triggers modal asking
for the file path first then cascades
materialization. That looks good. Create
ghost lesson works as today, available
everywhere. Delete action for real
lessons purges from the disk and the
database in one step. Yes. Delete action
for ghost lessons already unchanged. And
finally, convert to ghost stays for real
lessons that you want to keep planning
but remove from the disk. Exactly. So,
we've got that. This was essentially the
eight bullet points that we just spent
whoa, 22 minutes of video just uh trying
to get. This to me feels really, really
familiar. This is how I'm working with
AI a lot. I, you know, block out half an
hour in my calendar to work out exactly
the feature I want and from here it's
pretty much all on rails. Like we have
done the hard bit now. We have done the
human in the loop bit. What I do next is
I now I've been trying this for a few
days. I get it to update my ubiquitous
language documents to basically just
keep it up to date with any of the ideas
that I've got in here. For instance,
we've got some new terminology now.
We've got this idea of
ghost courses, which is new. Let's see
what edit it decided to make In In fact,
I'm just going to accept it and review
it afterwards. So, there we go. We can
see it's updated its idea of ghost
entities here. It's got ghost lessons,
ghost sections, and ghost courses. The
verb materialize is now properly in
here. The act of transitioning a ghost
entity to a real entity by creating its
on disk representation. I like too that
it has this create on disk and realize
like the aliases to avoid. That's really
cool. And it's even got a concept for
the materialization cascade. The chain
reaction when materializing a lesson
inside a ghost course. It signs file
path to course, materializes section,
then materializes lesson. I freaking
love this because later on I can say,
"Yeah, there's a bug inside the
materialization cascade." And it knows
exactly what I'm talking about. commit
this. Update to the ubiquitous language
document. Look at this. Yeah, sometimes
I am actually committing code myself.
Okay, so it's gone back to the grilling.
Yeah, it's now just sort of repeated the
eight sections. The existing plan entity
is a separate disconnected planning
tool. Yeah, I did used to have a
separate planning area, but then I sort
of used this ghost concept to integrate
it into my actual courses thing.
I've got it inside the ubiquitous
language inside here down here. A plan,
a plan section, and a plan lesson there.
But this is basically deprecated. I am
going to remove this at some point. And
so, we can say plans are deprecated and
ghost courses are the new way to do it.
And in fact, I think I'm going to go
ahead and say I'm satisfied. Let's and
I'll invoke my next skill, which is
let's write a PRD. So, if we think about
the conversation that we've just had
with the LLM, it's incredibly good
fodder for just turning this into a sort
of more
concise summary document of everything
that we want to build. I freaking love
question and answer because it
co-locates the question with the answer.
I know that sounds like such a sort of
basic thing to say, but the way that
these attention mechanisms work is that
stuff that's close together tends to
like it sort of shows up as a hot spot
for the LLM in terms of its attention
mechanism, just like it does for humans.
And what this ends up meaning is that
this is such a rich document for it to
pour through. Now, it's doing another
explore phase. We should probably do
like a cursory check on our context
window down here. We're currently only
at like 40K tokens, which is pretty
impressive given how long we've spent
with the LLM working on this stuff. A
lot of folks have asked me why my grill
me skill doesn't use the ask user
question tool. Like we weren't actually
sort of like using Claude's built-in
mechanism for asking questions. And the
reason for that is that I don't really
like that UI, first of all. And second,
like if you have a choice between
calling a tool and not calling a tool,
then like not calling a tool is always
going to be more token efficient because
every time you call a tool, you need to
wrap it in JSON, you need to do various
things. Okay dokey, we can see here that
okay, it's now sketching out the major
modules before writing the PRD. I've
talked before on this channel on how
important I think
modules are and like understanding the
modules in your code base without
necessarily needing to look inside them.
Like the course write service that we
looked at before, that's a big testable
module that I was very careful in
designing and designing the interface
for. And I think this is so important
that I've baked it into my write a PRD
skill. So, it sketches out the modules
and surfaces them to you. I don't
necessarily need to look inside these
modules. I just want to know how they're
changing. For instance, here I can see
something that's a bit dodgy, right? It
wants it to make a new method on the
course write service, materialize course
and lesson. Reuses the existing
materialize ghost and section
materializing logic internally. I'm
thinking about whether it could just
instead use the existing materialize
ghost and pass it like an additional
parameter,
but I think that would be a little bit
dodgy API API wise. So, I think it is
probably right. I think it should have a
new method. Notice how I'm thinking
about the interface more than I'm
actually thinking about the
implementation here. The implementation
I don't really care about, but I want to
make sure that this is testable and um
you know that the rest of the um
kind of repo and any future AI agents
can understand what it's doing. And
again, notice how easy these functions
are to name because we've got this
concept of the ubiquitous language. So,
module one is the ghost course schema DB
operations. That seems fine. The
materialization cascade service. That
seems fine. It's just a new method on
the course right service. Here we've got
two new API routes, which makes sense
because we're doing direct real lesson
creation, direct real lesson deletion. I
could um put them into like other API
routes, but because this is just an
internal tool, I don't really care about
what my API like looks like from the
outside, then I don't really care about
um how many API routes I have or what
they look like. It's just an
implementation detail. Now it's talking
about the
ghost course UI new add ghost course
option in the sidebar. Yep, that seems
fine. A materialization model two lesson
creation buttons in context menus and a
delete action. And then module six, the
plans deprecation. Hey, I mean I do want
to deprecate the plans at some point,
but I don't think I want to deprecate
plans now, certainly not as part of this
PRD. And it's asking me a second
question, which modules do you want
tests for? I want tests in the places
that we already have test harnesses. So,
for the course right service,
definitely. And if we have some stuff
for direct deletion, I think that would
be as part of the course right service,
too, right? So, let's see what it says
here. Now, this is funny. It's saying
there's no existing test harness for
course right service. The tests in the
repo are mostly for pure functions and
reducers. That is rubbish. So, I'm going
to do a Rafiki and I'm going to say,
"Look harder." And there we go. There
they are, a whole suite of them split by
concern.
Okay, and it's satisfied it has
everything it's needed. It's now going
to write the PRD and submit it as a
GitHub issue. This is what I do with my
PRDs. This is what I do with all of my
issues. I stick them in GitHub because
then when we go to actually implement
this with an AFK agent, the AFK agent is
going to pull down all of the GitHub
issues, choose the one it's going to
work on, and then just work on that one.
Now, a question becomes, am I going to
review this PRD? And no, I'm not going
to. LLMs are really, really good at
summarizing things. And so, I know that
this PRD will probably be a pretty good
summarization of this conversation. So,
I'm just going to accept it on faith,
and I'm then going to say, "PRD to
issues." So, it's now time to break this
PRD down into individual issues. The
benefit of doing this is that this now,
the PRD is already in its context from
having written it, and so we get to just
break the issues down straight from
there. These all have blocking
relationships in, so it's blocked by
nothing. This one's blocked by number
one. This one's also blocked by nothing.
That's cool. Now, let's just see how
many there are here. Six does feel about
right, I think. And what I mean by that
is this is going to get picked up by a
Ralph loop. And so, it's going to just
sort of work through each of these tasks
sequentially. And so, I want to pick
tasks that are not too big and not too
small because if they're too small, then
we pay the cost of like having to kick
up an entire agent just to do like
number two here, hide the publish export
UI on ghost courses. This is a tiny task
and it can be melded in with something
else. But maybe ghost course creation,
maybe no, that seems like decently sized
because it touches the UI, it touches
the schema, it touches the API. Two
lesson creation buttons, create ghost
lesson and create real lesson. This
seems super small. And actually, I think
it has broken them down a little bit too
far except maybe the materialization
cascade. That needs to live in its own.
So, I think maybe we just merge two and
three together and I think we'll be
happy. So, let's go down to the bottom.
Let's say merge two and three together.
Okay, now we got four slices. There goes
course creation, the UI stuff, the
direct delete action, and the
materialization cascade. Good stuff.
Let's go. Let's create the issues. Am I
going to review these issues? Absolutely
not. I understand like I've already sort
of pre-reviewed them. It's just
expanding out stuff that's in the PRD
and then, you know, putting them in
issues. This will be fine. just show you
one of them just to sort of see what
they look like. It links to the parent
PRD. It says exactly what to build. It
gives some acceptance criteria. Says
what it's blocked by and it also says
the user stories that are addressed in
the parent PRD. If the parent PRD is the
kind of destination, then these things
are the journey to get there. And notice
the PRD just has a bunch of user
stories, some implementation decisions,
and testing decisions as well. All of
this stuff essentially just comes from
the skills that I've put together and I
found that they're good enough to keep
the LLM on rails. I really like adding
in the testing decisions because it
means that it's more likely to follow
TDD and do some
um kind of create some feedback loops as
it's going, which is great. So, all
right. We have now set everything up so
make our AFK agent to give it the best
chance possible to produce good work.
Now, I've been like cooking my setup for
this a little bit over the last 24 hours
and I've sort of built like a mini
library to um
make it work better than I had it
before. The provisional name for this is
Sandcastle and we have a like a
Dockerfile here. It's going to spin up a
Docker container. It's going to mount
the
working directory inside this
Dockerfile. And then it's going to any
commits that are made then inside the
Dockerfile by Claude, which is going to
run in there, it's then going to patch
those out. So, pull out those commits as
patches and apply them to my local
repo. I found that this setup is just
like super flexible. I have a Dockerfile
and a prompt here and I can just run a
Ralph loop again and again and again,
passing in a bunch of issues and passing
in like the last X number of commits.
But, you can check out the repo to sort
of see the most up-to-date file on this.
I'm going to run, where is it? I think
it's PNPM Ralph. So, I'll run PNPM
Ralph. This is going to now spin up my
AFK agent with a max number of
iterations of 100. What it should do is
it will run out of GitHub issues because
it's going to close the GitHub issues as
it creates commits for them. But, at
this point, I can essentially just walk
away because, you know, we can see it's
like doing things in the terminal. It's
saying looking at the issues, directed
lead to action for Ralph, blah blah blah
blah. But, I can now have a cup of tea,
or I can go make a coffee or something,
or have my lunch. Or more likely, I can
just open up another terminal and enter
another grilling session. So, for folks
who say this approach seems really,
really slow, what you need to understand
is that it's slow because you're trying
to extract ideas out of your human
brain. And while this is happening,
you've got AFK agents running in the
background implementing your previous
grilling sessions. This is why this is
revolutionary because, like, once we've
completed thinking through the idea, our
work is kind of done until we actually
QA the outputs. My friend Jaman on
Twitter called this the day shift and
the night shift, where I'm doing the day
shift, I'm like, you know, thinking of
ideas, I'm grilling with the LM, I'm
turning this into PRDs, and turning
those PRDs into issues. And then the LM
takes the night shift. Claude goes and
actually implements this stuff AFK. So,
I'm going to take a little break. I
might even go for a little walk, and I'm
going to just wait and check back in
with this once it's done.
Okay, we are back. It is like an hour
and a half later. I, you know, went for
a walk. I went and had a cup of tea with
my parents. Uh, yeah. Let's see what
it's done. So, we can see that the agent
signaled completion after five
iterations. So, we essentially ran
cleared Claude code agent five times in
the repo, and it should have produced
for us, yeah, I think six commits here.
I think those commits, one of them might
be one that I just haven't pushed up
yet. Yeah, we can see the entire like
commit history here. It's been leaving
really nice detailed commit messages for
us, and it should be yeah. I think this
was the update that I pushed before or
haven't pushed so far. So, at this point
in the process, I need to um kind of
look back over these commits. I'm kind
of tempting to look over the code, but I
think I just want to review the
implementation first. going to open up a
new Claude session, and I haven't come
up with a skill for this yet. I so, I'm
just going to sort of free blast it. So,
I'm going to say, "Take the last five
commits and create a QA plan for me.
Save that QA plan in a GitHub issue. The
QA plan should give me a step-by-step
guide on how to test every single part
of the new implementation." This is
something I've been sort of playing
around with adding into my skills
because I think it does make sense
almost in every single sort of uh
user-facing change. And while it's doing
this, I'm going to rebuild the
application and rerun it locally so that
we can see exactly what's happening with
it. Okay, so it has created for us a QA
plan. Beautiful. Now, I have to say
there is nothing more boring than
watching else or watching someone else
do QA. So, what I'm going to do is just
walk through this um myself, and I will
come back to you if I have any issues.
Okay, the first one actually came super
early on, which is pressing this add
course modal. I can see now there's two
tabs in here. I actually really hate
this. Like, I just want uh every time
you add a new course, it should be a
ghost course, and I don't really like
the ghost course terminology appearing
in the UI. So, what I'm going to do is
exit out of this, and I'm I've got a
little feedback button here, which you
can see if I just remove myself there.
This feedback button, I can just
describe my feedback in detail, and then
it will create a GitHub issue for me,
which can then be picked up by the Ralph
loop. So, I'm going to say, "When I open
the add course modal, I want the only
option to be to add a ghost course. And
I don't want the ghost course to appear
in the UI. It should just look like
we're creating a course and then it
creates a ghost course. So, I'll submit
this and when I go to the GitHub issues,
we can see that we've now got a new
issue saying hide ghost course option
and add course model create ghost course
silently. So, I actually used high code
to generate me a title here and then
we've got the route it was submitted
from and then what I said in the
feedback button. This is how I do QA.
This information is enough for Ralph
[snorts] to do a really nice job here.
So, I'm actually going to start my Ralph
loop as I'm going here. I'm going to go
back to the QA plan and I'm just going
to add a comment to this and I'm going
to say Ralph loops should not work on
this one. This is a human in the loop
task only. Well, in fact, I'm just going
to rename that first one to AFK in fact.
I've got something in my prompt that
says if there's a human in the loop like
label on it or it looks like it's for
humans, don't work on it. And so, let's
go back in here. Let's run PNPM Ralph
again and it's going to actually work on
that issue while we're QAing other
stuff. So, I'll go back to doing a bit
of QA and I'll see you in a second.
Okay, a new thing is when I create a
ghost course here and I say new fun
course for instance, then when I press
create ghost course, nothing appears to
happen. But actually, as you can see in
the top left, oh, first of all, we get
the weird minified React error. So, I'll
just copy and paste that for the
feedback form later. It does actually
create the course, but we don't go to
the course and the model doesn't close.
So, let's add this back into feedback.
When I create a ghost course, it doesn't
direct me to the new page and it shows
this error. There's also no loading
state present on the button, which looks
confusing uh from the user's
perspective. So, let's submit that
again. The agent that we kicked off to
fix the previous bug is actually already
finished, so let's just kick it off
again and I'll keep QAing. This time I
won't interrupt. I'll just kind of keep
going through the issues and uh
attempting to fix them with Ralph in the
background.
Okay, this one I did think was showing
off here or worth showing off rather.
When I see a new ghost section inside a
ghost course and I right click here,
this create ghost lesson and create real
lesson doesn't seem right to me. I feel
like when I go into like create ghost
lesson here or create I just want an add
lesson kind of thing. We've already got
a modal here. What we should do is just
have a checkbox that says also create
this on the file system. So this is
something that came up in our early
discussions about this feature that kind
of like I couldn't get of sense for
which way to go until I saw it in
reality. So that's the way that
something's go sometimes. We could have
had an extra design phase or we could
have had an extra prototype phase, but
you know, I don't mind just jumping to
code and fixing it there. So I will add
some feedback for that, but I'll spare
you hearing my dictation.
All right then, I've walked through the
QA plan and I have created uh seven
issues here over the last uh or six
issues over the last 8 minutes. We can
see that while I've been QAing, Ralph
has been going in the background and is
fixing the issues. Most of these issues
are bugs, but some of them are features
that we just didn't think about. So for
instance, when we're deleting real
lessons, we want to add a confirmation
model to make sure that it doesn't just,
you know, like um
we don't accidentally click it and it
deletes or whatever. There were
certainly some showstopper bugs here.
For instance, if there's if it's not a
Git repo, uh then it gets into a super
weird state. Yeah, if the course repo's
not a Git repository and anything about
that fails, then we should walk back the
creation of the directory inside it
since the directory and file system and
the database will then be out of sync.
something again we didn't think about in
the grill me session at the start, so
we're now having to find out about it in
QA. It's this kind of stuff this kind of
stuff that makes me think that like the
specs to code approach is just never
going to work because when you're in
there, when you're in the QA loop, when
you're iterating towards something, you
are going to find little weird edge
cases like this that is really hard to
plan for before. Anyway, rant's over.
The point here is that I've now done a
extra QA step. Uh Ralph is now going to
chew through these issues. I can
probably actually close this QA plan. on
I might want to reopen it if I like um
sort of want to redo it, let's say, but
the behavior has slightly changed. So,
I'm closing it to take it out of Ralph's
or or rather the agent that I'm using's
context, so it doesn't look at this as
like the the source of truth for what
it's supposed to be building. Either
way, I'm going to go do something else,
and then we'll see what happens to Ralph
when it comes back.
Okay, we're back, and we've got
iteration eight, which is very nearly
complete. This looks like the final
issue here where it's just adding the
confirmation modal with file details
when deleting real lessons. We can see
we're up to 14 commits that have been
added kind of in this entire feature
build as we've been going along. And the
issues here are very nearly closed. You
can see I last opened this one 30
minutes ago, so that's how long it's
been running kind of. One thing I would
like to add here is potentially
parallelizing these Ralph loops and sort
of having like a team of agents working
on it at once. But to be honest, it's
quite nice having these gaps because it
means that I get to do some deep focus
on something, for instance, like
grilling me on something, and then later
I can come back and sort of come back to
code and do a big QA session, send it
off again, you know, you get the idea.
Something that's crucial to the success
of these Ralph loops is making sure it
runs tests and types on every single
commit. We can see that in most of these
loops it's adding tests, too, so it's
updating the reducer test to cover the
new action. Now, it's committing and
closing the issue, so we should be
nearly there. Okay, and we are good to
go. I'm going to
rerun the build, and let's do a little
bit more QA. And I'll spare you the
extra QA step here, but suffice to say
what I would do from this point on is I
would go back here and I would continue
QAing it, find more bugs, and at some
point I would call this done, and I
would stop working on it. One thing
that's great about having this really
flexible backlog approach is that
anytime I could just queue up a bunch of
bug fixes, and it would go in and fix
them. Let's just check one thing, which
is we can see that the add lesson now it
no longer says ghost lesson and real
lesson and we can see here it's saying
create on file system in a little
checkbox. If I go foobar and I say
create on file system, then it's going
to add the lesson and we should be able
to see once that's done. It's quite slow
that, isn't it? I'm interested in why
that's quite slow, especially because
this is all local. It should now be
complete and it creates that foobar as
the second lesson. So there we go. We
are, by my count, which is not entirely
accurate, it'll be about 42 minutes into
the video at this point.
If you're here, thank you so much for
watching all the way to the end. What I
hope you take out of this video, I'm not
sure to be honest. Like this is so much
looser than the videos I usually put
together, which are usually fairly
tight, focused on a specific goal. I
hope that you're able to pick up some
vibes from me in terms of how much
detail and how in-depth I look at the
stuff that I'm producing. You can also
notice how little I looked at the code
really. Like what I'm doing here is I'm
reviewing inputs and outputs. I'm
interested in the code, absolutely. I'm
interested in how the interfaces are
changing, I'm interested in how the
modules what the modules are sort of
looking like. And every so often I'll go
and have a little poke around in the
code just to make sure it's on the right
track. But for me really, what I'm doing
is reviewing the outputs that come from
AI, passing more information to it and
getting into a tight loop with it. And
crucially, because I'm able to run the
run Claude AFK, I'm able to parallelize
my own QA with the fixing of the bugs,
you know, which is just amazing. I
imagine though you have just dozens and
dozens of questions. Um feel free to
ping them into the comments below. Or if
you want to learn this from the ground
up instead of just diving through this
messy video, then the cohort is the
place. This one starts on March 30th,
but if you're seeing this sometime in
the future, then there'll probably be a
place you can sign up for the next one,
too. This has been the last kind of two
months of my life really, full-time
working on this. And I'm so proud of how
it's come together because everything
that you see here in this sort of big
video has come from me thinking about
this stuff deeply and the cohort is the
kind of perfect encapsulation, the
easiest way to learn this from the
ground up. Anyway, thank you so, so much
for watching. Thank you for getting to
this point, and I'll see you in the next
one.
