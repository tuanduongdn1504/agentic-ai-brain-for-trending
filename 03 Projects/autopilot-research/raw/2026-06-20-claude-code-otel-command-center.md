# Claude Code + OpenTelemetry = Claude Command Center — raw source bundle

> **What this is:** operator-submitted single video. The creator (Mansel Scheffel) demos a self-built, **observability-first** Claude Code "command center" fed by **OpenTelemetry (OTEL)** + **JSONL logs**, and argues *against* the elaborate "mission control" agent dashboards trending on YouTube. Panels: token-by-model, cache hit rate, MCP/API tool latency + error rate, skill activations + cost-per-run, context health, skills registry; plus a task-queue/scheduling layer (cron vs ad-hoc, per-skill model assignment) with **Telegram approval (human-in-the-loop)** and event-driven alerts. Closes with a "build your own" prompt (gated behind a Google Drive folder + a Skool community).
>
> **The "original resources" behind the video** (to be double-deep-dived per the operator ask): (1) **Claude Code's first-party OpenTelemetry / monitoring-usage docs** — the load-bearing original (env config + metric/event catalog + Max/Pro availability + the in-GUI dashboard); (2) **OpenTelemetry** the open standard (signals, OTLP, Collector, semantic conventions, backends); (3) the **observability backend stack** that visualizes OTLP (Grafana + Prometheus + Loki, or a managed backend); (4) **JSONL session logs** (Claude Code `~/.claude` transcripts + Cowork logs) + the native `/cost`; (5) **Code execution with MCP / programmatic tool calling** (the MCP-latency workaround the creator defers to "another video"); (6) the **Telegram HITL approval** pattern (already a vault topic — telegram-remote-control-stack).

**[00:01]** So, you're paying Anthropic $200 a month for Claude, and you have no idea what it's actually doing under the hood. In this video, I'll show you what a Claude command center looks like, why you don't need most of the mission controls you see on YouTube, and I'll drop you a prompt to build your own in the description below. Let's get into it. So, mission control is a really interesting concept to me, mostly because I think it's just completely unnecessary for what people out there on YouTube are currently building it for. While they're technically super impressive from the business use case perspective, all they're doing is adding

**[00:27]** to the context load problem. They're introducing a seven-layer microservice that absolutely doesn't need to exist. You do not need named agents to go out there and do work for you, especially if you are using Anthropic's ecosystem. It's way more efficient just to use skills and have them running on demand, on schedules and things like that. More importantly, if you want to have this front layer where you can communicate back and forth with an agent, that's why they built co-work. It is literally the sole purpose of this thing, and it can

**[00:55]** do 98% if not more of what you can do with your AI operating system in an IDE inside this little graphical user interface that's much better for business people out there. You can check out the video on the screen right now if you want to know how to build your own AI operating system inside co-work itself. For this video, I want to focus on the contrarian approach that for me, my command center is observability first, because that's where I think most of the value in actually having this thing comes into play. And then of course, inside here we have got some kind of task functionality, because

**[01:22]** there are a few edge cases where we would actually want to launch agents from inside this panel, and we'll get there in just a second. But please, everybody take a step back. The goal of whatever you're doing in life and business is to execute on your tasks with AI, not introduce all of these other systems that just complicate it. Skills exist for a reason, and we're going to exploit them as much as we can inside our environment. Great. And now that all the boring practicality stuff is out of the way, we can get into this video. So, our command center is to

**[01:50]** handle in-flight sessions, our task queue, and our schedules all in one place over here, and we can go through it layer by layer. More importantly, this thing is a persistent daemon, so it is always running locally on my system. It will go out there and find things that it needs to do, and make sure all my schedules are running as they should be, and finally it will report on literally anything that we can get our hands on. When we're looking at what Anthropic gives us, it gives us JSONL logs, which is just tracking everything that Claude and Claude co-work use. And then also, we have open telemetry now,

**[02:17]** which they finally released to people on the Max and Pro plans. Previously, it was only for enterprise people, and that's how you see this shiny little mediocre dashboard inside Claude code in the GUI. This dashboard over here is fed partially from OTEL, but that's what we can exploit massively over here because there is a ton of documentation. So, we can build out a lot of real-time info. As you can see, our dispatcher is running, and everything is working as it should be. We have no live sessions running currently. We'll kick one off in just a second. But posture is a really

**[02:44]** important thing to have on our observability dashboard, because it tells us two of the biggest problems that you will have in your business. One of them being security. Now, I have another video on this and exactly what the skill does, but essentially it's a skill that lives in our environment, and it runs out there doing an audit finding things like opportunities for MCP poisoning, various other MCP attacks, skill problems, various settings that we have in our environment that we might want to change because it can be exploited. So, we could run that task from this dashboard, and you should be

**[03:11]** running it regularly, probably on a schedule. But then if it found anything, you would be able to see the entire report over here so that you could act on it. Now, me having worked in cybersecurity for 12 years, you can see that I always keep my environment completely not up to date and in the worst possible practice. But that's because it's my dev environment, and I don't really care. On the right-hand side over here, we have context, and this is solving the context load problem that everybody has been facing. Again, I have another video on this as well. Anything that I mention here will be in the description below.

**[03:37]** But what this skill is doing is it's running through everything in your environment where you're being drastically inefficient with the way that you're handling context, with the goal being to turn all of that around by looking at this report to figure out what you can do to be better at using context within your environment. So, these two things are never static. You're not going to run the skill once and yes, we're set for the rest of our lives now, because AI evolves, the entire landscape evolves constantly, these two things will need to be run on regular intervals to make sure that you are doing the best practice at the time

**[04:05]** of whatever it is that is happening. So, for me, these are the two most important things that we are currently trying to solve now. Then next up, we have a quick panel on token usage, and that's just to give us an overview of the number of tokens that we've used by model over the last X number of days. This ties in with another panel that we're going to look in just a little bit. As we scroll down, we see the cache hit rate. This is super important. You want to make sure that you're hitting Anthropic's cache service as much as possible, because obviously that will save you some of your usage limit. These panels over here, they are

**[04:32]** important, but I'm not going to go into them because they're not important to this video. What I do want to focus on next is this mission control, and this is what a lot of people are doing now because they're trying to piggyback off of what paperclip and Hermes and whatever those things are that go out there and work autonomously for you. So, you can build that functionality, for sure, but you have to think about why you're building that functionality. For me, if I'm looking at doing something like researching leads or things that I know are predictable, I don't need

**[05:00]** mission control to that. I don't need a task board. I can just set up a scheduled task. There is no need to have this little agent window running away and doing things. If you're in co-work, it's easier than ever. You can just set up a scheduled task right over here. If you're in here, you could just set up a cron schedule, which you could do straight from your IDE. Or in this case, we obviously built in the capability to do that down here. So, before I'm about to come into my mission control and do anything, I'm going to be planning my business life out and figure out what needs to run on

**[05:27]** a schedule and what I might want to do on an ad hoc basis, and make sure I have concrete reasons behind both of those things. Then once I figured that out, I'm going to go into my environment, wherever that may be, and I'm going to start with the stuff that I can schedule so that everything is in place and running on autopilot already. Now, if I wasn't using co-work and for whatever reason I wanted to use this mission control, I would be able to click over here, and it's pretty much exactly what co-work has. We put in a name, so we could say morning brief and spell it

**[05:54]** like a weirdo. And then down here, we can just set the time I want this to run at 9:00 every single day of the week. Then it sets up our cron schedule. We can give it a task title and any details. This is obviously where we need to give it the name of the skill. In this case, it would be the morning brief skill, because this is going to be the command that gets sent to Claude. If that wasn't clear enough, you can obviously come down to your list of skills that we have mapped from our environment, and you could select it to go and run the thing based on there, and it could be enabled by default. Then we would just hit run, and we would have it

**[06:21]** as a list inside our scheduled tasks over here, running away on its cron schedule and doing whatever it needs to do. Then once I've done that, it brings us onto the case of okay, cool. Now I have some ad hoc tasks that I need to run. So, we might then come up to our queue task, and again, very similar window. We have separate options over here, so we can either have an interactive session where we can have a back and forth with the agent inside this little panel over here, or we do a one-shot, which is basically just firing a skill that we know works, making it

**[06:49]** happen once. Make me a gamma deck on Claude computer use. The MD file is in my deliverables folder. Something that also is important to note here is that by default, it's going to be selecting it from the skill. If you are creating skills, one of the most efficient things that you can do is obviously assign the model. This again helps you with all of that context load. You don't want everything running with Opus just because Opus is the best. Many tasks don't actually need this. For a complex task like creating a gamma deck, it might sound like you need Opus, but you don't. Unless this thing is going to be

**[07:16]** writing and doing a bunch of other things, you can easily get away with Sonnet, because most of the AI work is done by the gamma agent itself, obviously. So, we can get away with Sonnet for this, and that's exactly what we're going to do. If I had many tasks running at the same time, I could set a priority to make sure which one goes next after the other, based on that little setting over there. And also, you can have requires approval. This is important if you're doing things ad hoc where you need a human in the loop before we do that, and I've built a

**[07:43]** panel just for that. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit requires approval, and I'm going to queue this task. Now, what this thing does is it's also linked to my cell phone via Telegram. So, while this thing is waiting for approval, say something kicked off while I had to suddenly nip out for something, I could then come on over to my Telegram agent over here, and guess you can't see it on camera, but there you go. It's asking for approval. All I need to do is hit approve. That then changes on screen, as you can see, and the agent is now going

**[08:09]** to start running through this thing and do the task that I asked it to do. That's when we scroll back up here just to make sure everything's working as it should, and very, very soon this thing's going to populate a live session based on the agent task that it's got ahead of it. So, it's moved into running, and you can see over here that we've got two live sessions. One is the router from the IQ agent that routes tasks between everything, and then this one is just an interactive session of what's actually happening from the Sonnet agent over there. So, it's going out and searching

**[08:36]** in real time. This is just a live tail with grep, so it's nothing really crazy over here. But it's finding the relevant files, reading them, and then it's going to write the PSP, or in this case, it's going to use what I've already got there, which is the framework that I wrote for that video. So, I'm going to send it off to Gamma and do what it needs to do. And you can see over here that this thing went and found my PSP framework that I wrote for the video, so it's going to use this, and it's going to send it off to our Gamma agent. And you can see that's why it's much better to use something like this. There is no crazy agentic layer with Pikachu

**[09:05]** pictures drawn and Tamagotchi figures and stuff like that. You don't need that as a business. You just need to make money or execute on your goals. That's the whole point of this. Everything else is just a mess that you are one day going to have to manage or troubleshoot or deal with. You don't need that crap. Just use co-work. And with that micro rant out of the way, we're going to get into some of the more valuable things in here, which is understanding what's actually happening in depth in our environment, because this is how we refine, save money, and make the work that we do way more efficient. So, this

**[09:33]** dashboard is all about activity that's been going on in your environment. My favorite part of this is understanding the latency and error rate of all the tools that Claude is actually running into in my environment, specifically with MCP and APIs as well. It's going to help you understand where things could be going wrong as a part of your skills. For instance, in web fetch, if we constantly have a massive error rate, that could mean that one of our skills is constantly trying to access something that it can't. One of the most popular things is where it gets an access denied

**[09:59]** problem, in which case we could go and address that. But obviously we would want to make sure with more information first, and that's where we get into skills over here and understanding how often they run and how much they cost and things like that. So activations is really important because it shows us how many times over the last 24 hours our skills have been activated. So we get to see what we use most often, which obviously forms part of this picture. But then as we dive down further, we can see the frequency associated with the consumption. So our

**[10:27]** AI news monitor over here, we ran it over 23 sessions. You can see it used 32 million tokens. So this was something I addressed earlier because as soon as I saw that I was like, why the hell is my news monitor using so many tokens? So understanding things like this help you become more efficient as a business and mostly as how much you're spending with AI. Because if this stuff was actually going out through the API and not on my subscription, it would be such a waste of money. This process ended up being so massively simplified with the

**[10:54]** exact same result. I'm going to see a massive change in this. Next up, I obviously have to do Excalidraw. That's generally hungry because it draws lots and lots of slides. But the idea here is that you would be able to go through this and audit your environment to understand how to make it more efficient. We can then obviously see if there were any failures. Thankfully for me, I had absolutely none. And then we can also come and have a look at any previous sessions that were run. So this is the one that we just ran in the other window over here. You can see that this one has now completed, so it left that queue and it's come across into here

**[11:22]** where the recent sessions that have run over the last I don't know how many days, but we've got 19 here displaying just 10 of them. So this was the task that ran. We got our session ID, the model that was used, and how long this thing ran for. Pretty straightforward. It wasn't doing most of the work again, it was set up by Gamma. But the idea here is that you would be able to come down here and filter down to see if any of yours have failed. Something you could then do based off of this is obviously have event-driven decisions. So if something failed, you could get alerted either on your phone if it was

**[11:49]** that important, or you could get alerted by something else anywhere that goes into another system, so that system can then respond to it, maybe even redo the workflow. Whatever it is that you needed to respond to could happen as a result of this. That's again why observability is so important. Making event-driven decisions proactively and in some cases reactively, but at least without the human having to sit there and worry about it in an anxious state. This is very important if you're setting up an AI operating system for your clients. You want to know that their things are

**[12:16]** working. So if something does go down or something fails, they're not going to know about it unless you have set up something like this for you to monitor them, or they have someone on site, obviously. Then last but not least, we go over the skills and MCP in detail. So for me, I don't mind using MCP that much, but it is really hungry at certain times, depending on the task that you're doing. If you were doing this as part of a larger system where there are constant back and forths, it can really pollute whatever it is that your AI is working on. So this kind of helps with that. It

**[12:44]** helps us understand how much our tool runs are costing us with MCP. It tells us how slow everything is and the slowest parts of these tools. So for me working in Notion, update pages really slow, create databases slow, search is slow. There are ways around using MCP directly. We can use code execution, which is a another layer that I will discuss in another video because it deserves its own deep dive. Point is, there's lots of ways around these problems that we find, but unless we know about them, we can't solve them. So

**[13:13]** if you're using Notion heavily and you don't really need the visual there, you just only know it as a place to store documents, you might want to switch to Obsidian because then everything's local and all of the other benefits that you get with it. For me, I prefer a visual layer when I'm working, which is why I use Notion. And this helps me understand how my system is. For me, this kind of latency is minimal and even the token usage here is completely minimal, so I don't care. There's no way you can convince me to change that based on this. But it is all valuable information. Obviously we want to understand our skill cost per run as

**[13:40]** well, so we've got that included in here. This morning brief is more than the AI news monitor because this is something that I'm currently working on in three environments, running through multiple systems. So these metrics are a bit skewed, but the idea here is that this will obviously tell you what your most expensive skill is per run, not the accumulated one like we had in the other view. The idea being that you can assess all of this and then figure out how you can make these skills more performant because you wouldn't want them wasting as much tokens as they do. And then last but not least, we have the context

**[14:08]** health over here, which just tells you, again, based on the video that I had on context engineering and such things, how you could be better inside your environment using context overall in various places. And on the right, we just have a skills registry that shows us every single skill in all of our environments with a breakdown of what they do. This is just for a user perspective, so you have an audit of whatever's going on in your environment. Good to keep track of these so you can get rid of them whenever you don't need them, obviously. So from this perspective of the video, I think this

**[14:34]** is where the value of AI mission control comes in. Realistically, Cowerk again is just there for people who don't want to use an IDE. So using any of that other stuff is just fluff, guys. It is a distraction. It's pretty, it looks great, and sure, the people who put the time and effort into that, it is amazing, really smart, doing crazy things. But what does it actually do from a business perspective? Exactly. Just my maid vacuuming the lounge. That's the only sound we hear resonating when that answer comes up.

**[15:00]** But I do want to give you guys the capability to go and build this thing for yourself, so I've written you a prompt based off of what I built, and this thing will go out there for your environment, read all the latest docs that it needs to, and then pull down the same information. You can obviously tailor this to the way that you want it, specifically taking out things or including things. Again, if you don't need that mission control functionality, just completely get rid of it. All you have to do is copy this prompt, paste it in there, flip it over to plan mode. Of course, you don't just want to yolo your way through this. I have told this thing

**[15:27]** to do some of the latest research for the hotel logs and JSON L just so that it understands what it needs to do. Then you would hit enter and this thing will go out there and do that and probably ask you a few questions along the way. And that's really it in a nutshell. You can add or subtract as much functionality as you want. I don't think most of you are going to need that mission control there. But if you do, you can obviously just ask this thing to go and add that. Other than that, that pretty much wraps it up for this video. So thanks very much for watching, guys. Leave some comments below and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Otherwise, check out the videos on the screen now, they'll definitely help you on your journey. I'll see you in the
