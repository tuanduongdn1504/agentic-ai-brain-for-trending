## Full transcript (yt-dlp EN auto-captions, deduped, reconstructed from timestamped VTT)

This entire website was one-shot by Claude Fable 5 in a single skill. It's not just one scroll animations, it's several scroll animations that have been clipped together to give you a smooth, high-quality, coherent experience. This is absolutely wild. This is an extremely premium product and I'm going to show you the skill that lets you do all of this. On top of that, I will be showing you how I not only do this inside of Claude Code, but will be demoing the exact same thing inside of the brand new GPT-5.6 Sol. Because why stop with just one AI tool these days? And this thing is really cool. Like I said, if you try to do this manually without this sort of scroll animation skill I have found and improved, you know how difficult it is. You're making multiple videos, you're getting the starting frames, you're trying to make a match up, you're taking all the frames out one by one by one. It's a pain in the butt and this makes the entire process extremely easy to execute.

Now, the real credit for the skill goes to Peter Wing [auto-caption; a later mention renders it "Peter Wang"]. He's the one who made the original version. I found it on Twitter and he was nice enough to open source this. So, his Scroll World will be linked down below so you can take a look at it. Now, what I did is I forked this thing and I made a few improvements, namely introducing budget tiers so you can do this without having to spend as much. We don't necessarily need six different scenes for our website. And I included a lot of improvements on the mobile version of this and sort of SEO related stuff.

Now, the way these scroll animations work big picture is we start with a single image. That's what you see right here. We then take that image and we turn it into a video. This scroll animation at one point was a video. But we then take all the individual frames out of the video using FFmpeg and then we associate that with a position that you, the user, are at on the website. Now, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes to make it a smooth experience and so it isn't completely janky. And on top of that, we're making sure all our scenes sort of reference each other when we build them. That way, they all look coherent. Like this all looks like it was from some singular story.

As for how we're actually generating the images and videos, we're doing that through the Higgs Field MCP. And we can do this both with Claude code and Codex. We never have to leave the terminal. It's calling all those image models, namely GPT image 2, and all the video models, namely Seed Dance, through that MCP or the CLI. Now, to connect those tools to your AI agent of choice, you're just going to go to Higgs Field, you'll go to MCP and CLI, and you're just going to follow these steps. You're just going to copy the URL for the MCP and then do the authentication process. The only thing you need after is the skill itself. And I will have my version linked down below as well. You can just copy the URL, give it to Claude code or Codex, or you can do it as a plugin. Either way works.

Now, as I said in the intro, I'm going to be demoing this inside of Codex with a brand new Sol 5.6, but this is what it looked like inside of Claude code. It's the exact same process. You go through an interview, you tell it what sort of website you're trying to build, what you want each scene to be, and it's going to walk you through step by step, and it's going to make sure like, "Hey, do you like this image?" before it actually goes and creates all the videos. You don't just run the skill and all the videos just show up and you have no sort of say in the process. So, it really holds your hand throughout the entire thing.

So, inside of Codex, I have called the Scroll World skill. So, I just did /Scroll World, and I said, "I'm trying to create a website for a boutique Japan travel brand, and the general art direction I want is we're going to kind of go with like an origami style." Now, if you don't know what style you want, you can just have a back and forth with AI, and it will kind of ask you several questions. I already knew ahead of time kind of what I wanted, so don't worry if you don't have an exact idea when you show up. Now, after you give it some creative direction, then it's going to ask you, "What do you want to do in terms of the budget, and what do you want to do in terms of mobile?" Budget-wise, it's saying, "How many scenes do you want?" For reference, this was six scenes. This is a significant amount of video, and it's actually a pretty long journey from beginning to end. This is probably overkill for most people. On top of that, this is going to cost you a lot of Higgs Field credits. It cost me about 800 at the end of the day. So, if you're not on one of the more expensive plans, you probably want to stick with four scenes, I think is like a great sweet spot.

The next is what you want to do with mobile. So, you can do everything from just sort of like cropping it safely all the way to a full portrait chain where it's going to create extra videos specifically for mobile. So, you have some room to work with like how deep you want to go on that front. But, this video we're just going to do lean and crop-save. So, it's sort of the cheapest options. And I understand you can do less scenes as well. You can get it down to three. This is just what it offers as a default.

It then is going to take you through the journey proposal and say, "Hey, this is what each scene is going to look like." And it's like, "This is how many generations it's going to take." So, it's going to take total four image generations, four scene dive videos. There needs to be a connector between some of the videos and some cross fade. So, total it's saying nine generations. And it gives you an expected generation time, which usually pretty conservative. It doesn't usually take that long even though we're talking about AI video. And so, once you approve that, the next thing it's going to do is generate the anchor. The anchor is going to be that starting frame. And we talk about that starting frame, we're talking about something similar to this in the background. It's just going to be a still image and it's on you now to be like, "Okay, I like this. This is the art direction that's going to dominate throughout." Or, "No, let's change some pieces." This is the part you really have to nail because if you don't like it and you say yes, everything's going to be based on it. So, here's a look at the image it created and I like it.

Now, you probably realize this already. If you were doing all this through Codex and through Sol, well, it has image generation. We don't need to send any request to Higgs Field to create images with GPT image 2 when we natively have that ability inside of Codex. So, you can have Codex do that natively, but you still are going to have to send it to Higgs Field for the video generation. On the flip side, if you're doing this in Claude code, obviously it doesn't have image generation. So, Higgs Field has to carry the load the entire length of the way. But, here's the image. I like it. So, what are we going to do? We're going to say, "Hey, this is great. Can't type. Move forward."

So, after 32 minutes, it's completed our website. We got four different scenes. It took 10 generations, and now it's up on our localhost ready to go. So, let's take a look. So, here's our Japanese tour website. What we're going to do is we're just going to scroll through it and kind of just get a once-over. So, got people traveling, got the subway. We move here to the house. It opens up. Then they go to the hotel. It unfolds. Kind of cool. And then we have the bird over here, which starts to fly.

So, overall, what do I like? What do I don't like? I like the visuals. Like, I think this looks super cool. You know, I think individually within each scene, I like how each individual scene progress. Like, this part where the subway comes in, awesome. My problem here is the transition. When we go from scene one to scene two, pretty hard cut. Maybe you want a hard cut. Kind of I guess that's there's some creative direction there. But, that's something we could change. Same thing here. As we go from scene two, incredible detail, to be honest. But, as we go from scene two to three, again, another hard cut. Versus scene three to four, I think this is an awesome transition. So, this opens up. Boom, they're in the hotel. But, if you watch in the background, notice the scene number four like coming into frame. Like, at first it's blurred, pops up, gives like very much like this 3D effect, and gives depth to the website, and then it seamlessly transitions to scene four. Like, that is a great. If it had that going from scene one to two and from two to three, I would be super happy. That's my primary complaint with this.

But, everything else looks good, and being able to add those sort of scene transitions and smoothing out, I don't think it would be too difficult. Because if you compare that generation, which again was Sol GPT 5.6, to what we created in Claude Code, the scene transitions are definitely a bit more sleeker here. So, this is scene one. Right? So, like these things push out of the top and it is like a seamless transition into those being like well, as close to seamless as you get to those being like wires here. Same thing right here. We go in. Oh, boom. It opens up and then we just go over the top to the next scene. So, scene to scene with the Fable 5 transitions, I think we're better. Same thing here. Boom. We're here. Zoom out. Next scene.

So, that's my chief complaint. I would definitely give Fable 5 the edge versus Sol 5.6 here. But, like this is a one-shot, right? Like with a single skill. Like I'm very impressed in general with how well the skill's been, you know, created. This is awesome.

Now, the next question becomes, okay, this is a visual spectacle. Can we make this into a website that's more functional depending on what you're trying to do? And I don't think that's a problem at all. I think the technical problems of creating an animated scrolling website like this that looks coherent and doesn't look janky and doesn't look low quality is pretty difficult. You know, if I asked you to just do this on your own, I think you'd have a lot of trouble and take a lot of time to get there. With this sort of base, I think it's really easy to then like, okay, like what are we doing with the text? What are we doing with the CTA? How are we actually pulling the user from the hero all the way to like filling out some sort of form? I don't think that's too difficult. I don't think we're like, you know, having to reinvent the wheel there. That's what every single website does. And being able to put that on top of what we have here, again, with Fable 5 and with 5.6 is not a challenge whatsoever.

And the fact that this is just one skill in a one-shot is kind of mind-blowing. Again, if you want to do this on your own, 3 months ago, 6 months ago, 9 months ago, it's kind of a pain in the butt. So again, shout out to Peter Wang for the original version of the skill. Both versions, both mine and his, will be linked at the bottom of the description. And like you saw, this is like super straightforward. You really don't have to do anything. You just need to show up. You need to invoke the skill. You need to give it some sort of creative direction and then it's just going to go to work.

So, that is where I'm going to actually leave you guys for today. Let me know as always of what you thought about this in the comments.
