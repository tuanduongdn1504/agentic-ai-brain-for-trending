[00:01]
Let's take a look at hub and spoke
architecture. So, hub and spoke
architecture is a pattern where one
coordinator agent sits at the center and
all sub agents talk to the coordinator.
I highlighted that weird word
coordinator because you're going to be
seeing a lot of coordinator agent. And
when you think of like Claude
Claude code, I have a feeling that this
is at least one of the means at least
when you're working with sub agents of
our communication, right? So, this is
going to be something really really
useful to learn.
It's going to be really fun and
something that you can apply
like immediately, okay? So, sub agents
never have direct lines to each other.
So, if you have like a research agent
over here, it cannot directly talk
to the review agent a river agent. It
has to go through the coordinator.
And so, that is pretty clear. And the
coordinator is going to own the routing.
So, it's going to decide how to route
things. Context sharing, so what will be
shared? So, the research agent is not
going to be aware of what everyone's
doing unless the coordinator passes that
information along and it gets injected.
So,
it really won't know.
And any kind of error handling, any kind
of observability, any anything like
that, okay?
And obviously that would
make it really good for observability
because now everything's passing through
there and we have a choke point where we

[01:15]
can check and collect information,
right?
And so, here we have kind of the task
life cycle
of like, okay, we have something that
needs to be done and how is it going to
get executed out? So, the role of that
coordinator is task decomposition. So,
break
the task into subtasks, right? Then we
have task delegation. So, who is going
to be working on that problem? Result
aggregation. So, bring it all back
together
to produce a final result and decide
which sub agents to invoke based on
query complexity. So, um you know, we
have a a lot of things going on here,
but let's just kind of walk through it.
So, imagine you're a coordinator and
when given a task, it'll break down
subtask for each of the available tools
and we're saying do not do the work
yourself. So, we're basically here
defining
you know, that you are a coordinator and
this is what you're going to be doing,
okay?
And then here it's like you're a
coordinator and use your judgment.
Simple factual questions, use a single
agent. Multi-step task, delegate out to
a sequential passing the results
forward. Independent subtask, delegate
in parallel. So, we're basically
defining, okay, what does the routing
look like? So, it's not just like static
routing. Like it's, you know, use the
routing you need to route based on the
use case, right?

[02:35]
Which I think is really really
interesting. And then down below here
it's like, okay, you've gotten all the
outputs from multiple agents, combine
them into a single coherent response,
resolve any conflicts and make the data
pretty. So,
that's the most basic thing when we're
talking about this coordinator agent.
There's a lot of stuff we have to
consider when implementing this, but we
will go and set up a super skeleton one
really quickly here and then we will
iterate on it, okay?
Okay, folks. So, what I want to do in
this follow along is implement a very
simple
coordinator agent. So, we'll say
coordinator
agent
or basic.
And in here we will make a new main
.py
And I suppose that we could
um
pull up some code. I'm going to see if
we can switch over to Haiku
and save some credits here
because it might be able to do it. We'll
see.
Haiku. There we go. So, now it's
switched over to the Haiku 4.5 model.
And so, I'm going to tell it uh
um create
uh
a very basic coordinator agent
in
coordinator basic main.py
Please follow
our general

[04:06]
coding
example would be
uh what was one we did? Decision making
would probably be one
model driven
model driven.py. And so, I'm hoping that
by giving it that reference, it will
know how to reference that stuff and
produce something that's going to be
generally okay,
but we'll see how Haiku does. I really
should run Haiku a lot more. I just kind
of stick at Sonnet. Um
and that's my that's my fault there,
right? And so, we will give it a bit of
time here, let it accept here and then
we will decide whether Haiku could even
do it or not and does it have all the
components we need? And there it is.
That was pretty darn fast. Maybe it
needs a little bit more work to do.
But we have the start of it. Let's close
out the tab here. Sometimes it helps to
close out the tab and reopen it for
whatever reason. It's already done. So,
here it says I've created a basic
coordinator. We have create task, get
task status, complete task task list.
And so, we have the basic stuff. Let's
take a look here and see if it's any
good. Um so, we have tool
implementation. So, tool create task.
Um task status. And so, it's talking
about how it has to manage the tasks
generically.
Right?
Um then down below here, yep, so we have
that.
Create a task with an optional list of
task IDs.

[05:22]
Um get the current status of the
specific task, mark it as complete, list
all tasks as completed.
Um so, it seems like it's pretty simple.
Your role is to manage and coordinate
tasks.
Well, a coordinator does that in
general, but I guess the thing is like
this is literally it sounds like it's
managing tasks. Create tasks as needed
for the workflow, check the task status
and dependencies, complete tasks when
appropriate. So, what I'm trying to
figure out here is what is the use case?
So, set up a
Let's go down here for a second. So, we
have
user message. So, set up a workflow
create a task design and then create a
task implementation that depends on
design and then complete design task
first. This is so generic, it's really
hard to make sense of it. We have our
while loop here. It brought in the while
true, so we don't have that max
iteration.
Um
And maybe maybe might not be a a major
issue, but we still might want that in
there. I probably should have referenced
the other code.
And
Mhm.
So, I'm just carefully looking here
at what we have.
So, we have our tools over here.
And so, I'm not really sure if that
really fits our pattern exactly. I'm
going to go take a look at our
uh diagram here. What do we have? We

[06:39]
have decom decompose
uh the routing and the aggregation,
right? So, um
I don't think I see all those steps
here. Okay, so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go back to our smarter
model here, Sonnet.
Okay.
And I'm going to go and ask the
or I'm going to ask
it to improve our coordinator code. So,
uh you know, for a coordinator agent
we should have
decomposition tasks.
Just a moment here.
Routing.
It says assess complexity, but we have
routing.
We'll say assess complexity
complexity
and routing and aggregate
results. The use case here is
too generic.
Need
a better
use case. Okay. And so, we'll go ahead
and we'll see if it can improve that
code. And if not, I might have to write
even more detailed prompt. I'm just kind
of low
on our usage unless
the window has rolled over.
Let me take a look here.
Nope, I still got 50 minutes for my time
to roll over over here, but we'll see.
And so, I just wanted to kind of see it
mimic these patterns here. And so, it's
not to say that it's not exactly doing
it, but it's definitely uh
not that sophisticated, right?

[08:29]
Because I would expect there to be a
prompt for the routing component here
and I'm not seeing it here, right?
It does say set up a workflow. So,
technically that is that that right
there.
So, maybe maybe it is kind of being
implemented, but we'll give it a second
here. Now, I'll rewrite a concrete use
case. Technical due diligence, decompose
the complex software review.
Oh, I don't like that.
No, I'm going to stop this for a second
here. Stop stop stop stop. I I don't
like the use case.
Oh, it already stopped, basically.
So, it says breaks the request into five
fixed areas. Well, I already got the
code, I guess. Let's just take a look
here.
So, here it says a user submits a
software system for technical review.
The coordinator has a decomposed the
requests assesses the complexity per
area, routes and and does that, runs an
appropriate handler, aggregates all
findings into a single report. So, that
sounds good.
Uh we have tool decompose request, tool
assess complexity.
I don't really like
the use case because I want something
that's going to be easy for us to
validate and test and this will be too
complicated. I don't like the use case.
Can you propose to me
uh 10 possible use cases.
I want something that,
uh,
is not super complex

[10:06]
that will be like super computational
but would need complex routing and
choices.
Uh,
don't implement, just
suggest ideas. Okay. And so, I want to
see if we can pick something a bit
better. If it can't, then I might have
to, uh, decide on myself here. Here's a
So, job application screener.
Um,
event planning coordinator, bug triage,
restaurant order customizer.
I mean, I like the travel one that might
have to go through the internet. I don't
necessarily want to do that.
Mm.
Okay. So, like with number
what would be the subtasks?
The subagents used.
Because this is what I'm trying to
figure out. And this comes back to, you
know, this idea where we have an idea
and it's doing a bunch of stuff, right?
So, like coder, writer, researcher,
planner, data, right? So, I'm trying to
see what we have.
And so, we go over to here.
And so, we have request to composer. So,
takes the job posting
resume extracts it out.
Looks at each criteria and decides the
Okay. Executing execution phase.
Um, the actual routing targets.
Aggregation phase.
And so, it has two different ones here.
So, I guess my question is like, is the
ownership
I mean, like, should the coordinator
be routing to a decomposer

[11:59]
and
router routing because I thought
the composer is supposed to
own it
in a hub and spoke
architecture. And so, that's the only
thing I'm I'm just making sure like
maybe these are just tools and it's
calling out to them and so, it still has
ownership. So, you're right. In a proper
hub and spoke architecture, the
coordinator is the hub. It owns it. The
decomposer isn't a sub subagent. That's
why the coordinator owns its
responsibility. So, we have that. Sure.
That looks like something.
So, the coordinator decomposes, assess
complexity, decides routing, aggregates.
The spokes just execute. This smells
like something belongs to the
coordinator versus subagent. Does it
need a full picture?
Does it need the full picture to do the
its job? Decomposer is always routing,
always needs the full picture.
Uh, I don't
I don't I don't know what you mean by
full picture.
But we are implementing
hub and spoke model
architecture. Okay. So, I don't know
what he's trying to say there, but, um,
maybe it means like I think I think that
the context. You're right. Okay. So, it
says you're right. Oh, yeah, of course
I'm always right. Um, receives the
request, call spokes, aggregates the
results.
Independent workers, each job does one,
no knowledge of each other. That's

[13:28]
right. Okay. So, for job app application
screener, now we have keyword scanner,
deep evaluation, red flag detector,
score aggregator.
Takes all the spoke spoke outputs.
The coordinator owns calling each spoke
with the right input deciding which
spoke to call
collecting and combining their outputs.
Yes. Okay. And so, now we're getting
something there.
Just because it said it did it, does not
mean it did. And this is me looking at
it going,
"Uh, that doesn't seem right." Right?
Um, and so, we will let it go ahead and
do that. I'm not getting any more
warnings. So, oh, it says now using
extra credits.
So, I'm over my usage.
&gt;&gt; [laughter]
&gt;&gt; But I should be okay.
This is You'd be surprised how long or
how far five five dollars will take you
Okay. So, it says it's completed the
architecture here.
Um, let's go take a look and check out
the code.
So, now we got a lot of stuff here.
Okay. So, keyword scanner prompt. You
are a resume keyword scanner. Check
whether it required skills from the job
posting, uh, appear explicitly in the
resume.
For each required skill, output one
line. Be literal. Do not infer or
extrapolate. Report only what is
explicitly stated. Okay. And so, then we
basically have all the ones here and
they're fine. Of course, if we're doing

[14:46]
this for real, we would be tweaking this
all by hand, of course. And then here we
have the actual, um,
I guess they're saying the spokes. We
could say subagents, if you would, or
they have them called the spokes.
And each of them are individually
calling
uh, this stuff. I'm not sure why they're
doing it this way. It seems like this
could be easily refactored. This seems a
little bit, uh,
messy. Maybe they're doing this so that
you could improve it later on, but to me
this,
um, seems like this should all be just
one function.
And then we have the spoke aggregator
where there actually is a little bit
different. So,
they do have that there, which is fine.
Then we have our dispatch tool.
Okay. So, basically like where should it
go? We have
And yeah, whether it should go there or
not. Tool schema. So, what the
coordinator hub sees.
So, we have run keyword scanner.
Oh, like these are the actual tools
deciding whether they should get
triggered or not. That's fine.
Then we have our coordinator prompt. So,
you are a job application screening
coordinator. That's fine. Your job is to
orchestrate three independent screening
agents.
Uh, your job is to orchestrate the three
independent screening agents and then
aggregate the results.
You may run three screening agents in

[16:05]
order. Do not skip any of them. And so,
here it's defining that saying you have
a explicit order. And so, obviously
there could be more complex routing than
this, but this is all there is.
Then we'll go down to here.
And so, here we have our job postings. I
was going to wonder where this data was.
Cuz I was going to be like, is there,
are the resumes generated here? And they
do. So, our we have our job posting,
then we have our our resume. We only
have we only have a single resume, which
is fine.
Alex Chen, that's interesting. Okay. So,
we go down here and we're passing that
data in. It's going through that loop.
Again, we have this while true. So, I'm
not sure if that's the best idea to have
that while true like there, but I will
run it and
take the risk.
I think it's fine.
Uh, you know what? I I do want a max
iteration. So, I'm going to go here and
just say like
uh, the while loop is true. Do you think
we should have a
max iteration or any other suggestions
so it doesn't go
on forever.
Okay. And so, that's
what I want it to answer there. We have
the max We might just do the max
iteration cuz now I've basically told it
to do that.
So, here it says, um, a while true loop
with no exit condition. I mean, there is
an exit condition. It's the break right
And then we have a timeout for this use

[17:41]
case.
So, a max steps caps is is the right
fit. That's what it's suggesting.
Fair enough.
How's it uh, counting the max steps?
So, the loop executes only when the
condition becomes false, max steps, and
not when and not when the break is hit.
So, it cleanly catches runaway loops
without needing extra flag. Okay, that's
fine. The cap is 10, double the expected
five steps, give the model room to
retry. I just don't see where it's
counting them. Oh, I guess it's right
Oh, sure.
I I guess so, but I mean, that's the
same thing as a max iteration.
Um, so,
max steps is the same as
max iteration.
I guess it's fine. I mean, I'm sure it
will still work. So,
if it doesn't, we'll find out. And
again, you know, you can just watch and
see what my outcome is before you do
this if you do not want to waste credits
because I've made a poor decision. Um,
you know, like I'm loading my thing up
with like five dollars at a time. So,
I'm I'm not that worried about, um,
uh, small losses like that. So, we'll go
ahead and go into here.
And let's go ahead and execute this.
And yeah, I'm not using my subscription.
Now, we could probably port this over to
agent SDK,
um, and this would be greatly
simplified. We might do that later to
see what's happening here, but won't do
it right away. So, here it says, um,

[19:23]
coordinator routes to the spoke.
Okay. So, it's found stuff. Something's
missing. Coordinator routes to the run
deep evaluator.
Uh, strong alignment with the senior
level role with seven years of total
experience. Cool. Strong fit.
Uh, coordinator routes to the red flag
detector.
Imagine someone, uh, just coded this and
this is what's keeping people out of
their jobs. That that would be a bummer.
And then we have step two
of 10. So, match keywords.
Uh, strong, no flags, decision higher.
Alex demonstrates strong alignment with
senior level requirements. Coordinator
for final recommendation for hire, so
it's recommending it.
Six out of the seven, strong, no red
flags.
All core required skills present.
Seven years experience, whatever,
whatever.
And so we just implemented our own
coordinator. Again, the only thing
that's really simple, like I'm still not
the confident about the wild loop, but
the only thing that is um
very simple is the routing. But the
routing obviously is being handled here.
Um and so, you know, like in that
diagram, it just seems like it's a
separate step. Like you cut them up and
then you do that.
Um and so I'm not sure if that should be
separated out, but the point is we did
implement coordinator agent. Um and
that's something we could decide later
on if we wanted to have an individual

[20:42]
step for more intelligent routing. So,
that's the only thing that I might um
consider. Like I I would probably ask it
right now like if it should be ran
twice, but I'm I don't know. I don't
want to
cuz I don't think it's going to just
tell me. I think it's going to actually
try to do it. And so I don't want to
muck with it. And so I'd say that's
fine, but just consider that that's an
uncertainty that I have right now.
And so I'm going to go back a directory
here. We'll just say get at all, get
commit {hyphen} M. Uh
basic coordinator.
I thought that was kind of fun.
I thought the results were pretty good.
Okay, and I will see you in the next
one, okay? Ciao, ciao.
Okay, let's take a look at narrow task
decomposition. So, when uh Claude decom-
decomposes a task, it can only delegate
what it thinks to ask for. Okay, so here
we have an example where it says, "Give
me a comprehensive analysis of the EV
market. Break the user's task into
subtasks and delegate them out." And so
here we see the subtasks. We have
research EV sales figures, research EV
battery technology, research major EV
manufacturers. So, the initial
decomposition is too narrow, entire
topics never get researched. It's
because each subagent only sees its uh
its its own isolated context. None of
them can flag what's missing. So, what
got missed? Charging infrastructure,
government policies and subsidies,
second-hand EV markets, consumer

[22:10]
sentiment and adoption barriers, supply
chains like lithium and cobalt, grid
capacity implications. Okay? Um so, you
need to be very specific on the task so
it fully covers what you expect. So,
here it says, "Give me a comprehensive
analysis of the EV market." Again, and
so as the coordinator, when decomposing
the task, of course we're generating out
the the subtasks, but ask yourself,
you know, more information. Ask subtasks
to cover those gaps. Only then begin
delegating. And for research tasks,
specifically consider this information.
Now, what's interesting here is like we
created
um in our our job application thing, but
this thing is talking about research.
So, they might they might have just a
single subagent that just does research.
And so the idea is that all these tasks
are going to the same subagent as maybe
separate um
instances that are spawned, and they're
being tasked with doing different
things. And so this is where you have a
little bit more complex routing, right?
Or different kinds of routing. Um
and so one thing that we can do to catch
weak decomposition is uh cuz like let's
say um for whatever reason,
in here, uh this coordinator uh that you
wrote here to help it be very specific,
uh it fails or you just don't do a good
job. Then you could implement a tool.
And so the tool um can try to catch it.
Because now when the court or when the
agent goes and does a task, it's going
to say, "Oh, did you submit a a subtask
breakdown for review for delegating?"

[23:43]
Well, then trigger this tool and then
make sure right here that you do this
up. And this gives you a guarantee um
you know, of this. Or maybe you want to
be a little bit more flexible what the
input is from the user. And uh so this
thing being decoupled might do that. Um
another way uh that you can fix this
problem is at the aggregate level. So,
after you're aggregating the results, it
can check here and say, "Hey, um did you
make sure before writing the answer that
you uh met these things?" And so you now
have basically two different safeguards
for um improving over uh narrow task
decomposition. So, I'm not sure if this
will work in the one that we're building
right now or we'll have to build a new
little coordinator. Um but we'll go and
try it out, okay?
All right, so we are back. And um what
we'll do here is we'll try to figure out
this narrow task decomposition. I don't
know if it's going to work for our case.
Because um for research, it's a really
good um use case, but will it be for
this one? I don't know.
Um so, I'm going to go ahead and just
copy all this code here because we
already have some of this. Good.
And Claude's going to have an easier
time working
with tweaking that.
I would have an easier time working off
of this.
So, um
let's go down to where the main
coordinator prompt is. So, here it says,
"Uh you're a job application screening
coordinator. Your job is to orchestrate

[25:10]
three independent screening agents and
the aggregate their results. Run all
three screening agents,
keywords, deep evaluators, detectors.
So, um let's go ahead and just ask it."
Okay, so we'll go here.
We'll say, um for our
narrow task decomposition main
for
uh our coordinator prompt,
is the uh decomposition
is our
task decomposition
too narrow?
And what do we need
to ask for better
decomposition?
Okay, because this one's pretty darn
simple, right? It's just like there's
these three things, feed it into those
three things. Cuz it's not conducting
research, right? Um it's not going out
and looking at large bodies of text and
trying to figure it out.
So, you know, maybe if there was like
more than one source, then that would be
useful. And so maybe that's what we
might recommend here in just a moment. I
might say, "Hey, like uh you know,
assume that you're ingesting more than
one source of information, um and that
might be a better example." But let's
see what it comes back with here, and
then I'll tell you whether I agree with
it or not. Just because it will produce
something doesn't mean that it's useful.
So, we will find out here, okay?
Also, I was just thinking about this.
What we should have done is just taken
the coordinator information and provided

[26:41]
it uh to here with the basic information
because I feel like it's consuming a lot
more um tokens than it should require. I
mean, it's not saying there's that many
here, but it is taking uh some time
here, and I again I'll just wait, but I
should have really just extracted out
that individual information.
So, let's take a look here. And oh,
yeah, we can edit the main file. That's
fine, yep. I thought it was done. I
guess it's not done.
Okay, so let's take a look at the
problem here.
Spokes are narrowly scoped but
appropriately interpretive. That's
actually reasonable. But if you're
designing new coordinators,
well, I'm not designing new
coordinators. But we'll we'll take a
look here. Spokes answers what is X.
Python found.
But without access to the resume.
Um spokes answers what does X mean for
the higher?
Receives pre-interpreted signals and can
make the uh integrated judgment.
So, I guess we're trying to determine
like is it fine? So, what to ask? So,
so is it narrow? So, is skill X listed?
Does experience demonstrate the skills X
required? So, if it's narrow, saying
like is it just listed or is it actually
telling us? So, that would be better.
That's true.
Uh narrow, resume only. And so this is
what I was talking about where we would
have more than one type of um
uh information feed. But here it's
saying in feed in the resume and the job

[28:08]
posting for the fit.
Context, what granu- granularity? So,
one spoke per keyword, one spoke per uh
decision dimension, whatever. So, this
file runs both the coordinator of the
same candidate.
So, you can see how the narrow
decomposition loses
the 50 million requests per day nuance.
While the better one catches it.
Okay, so we'll go back up to here. I'm
just trying to make clear the this thing
that we're looking at. So, narrow
antipattern.
What is X? Python found.
Six years, three, no gaps. That's
probably like how actually recruitment
people work. They aggregate receives new
facts, it still has to do all the
reasoning, but now without access to the
So, it spokes answers what does X mean
for the higher?
Strong trajectory risk. Okay, so one
thing I I was thinking of is like
you need to cross-coordinate this
information, right?
I would say, you know, one thing one
thing I noticed is, you know, can we
validate
the number of years
based on based on the resume
information?
Can we mock
other data sources that uh that we would
feed in where uh if we didn't do better
with very specific
things to check,
we would run into an issue?
Because that's I think what's going to
take it, but like that was one example

[29:49]
of like, okay, well, you know, if you
had to validate how many years someone
had experience, you'd look at the
resume, but you might also look at uh
projects or references or other stuff.
And so, let's just see if it can, you
know, consider other data sources.
Uh maybe we should just want to do EV
one because research is a really a
really good one, but I mean in the sense
like we are researching if there are
multiple things. Like maybe they have
blog posts and stuff like that. But
we'll we'll see what comes back here and
I might make send uh suggestions for
data sources, okay?
All right, it is back. Let's see what
it's done. So, we'll go up to here. Key
addition. So, show activity since 2018
from uh a Git profile. Let's see. All
All assessed skills are above senior
threshold. Verified 7.6 years
experience.
okay. I mean, did it run it again? I
didn't tell it to run it, but um
I guess what we should do is just take a
look
at what the new coordinator information
is.
Your job is to coordinate uh three
I mean, this isn't
this is showing steps, which is fine.
But we're not seeing
it doesn't seem to understand what I'm
trying to tell it. Okay. So,
No, I don't think it understands. So,
what I'll do, just give me a second
I need to give it an example and I just
need to extract out of that.
Give it a better example here and we're

[31:18]
just going to plot I have my screenshot.
I just don't have the raw data. And so,
I'm just going to
uh chat GPT or something here off screen
be like, uh get me get me the text.
And just give me just a moment here.
Just getting the text here off screen.
See, so getting the text.
And I'm going to feed it as an example
of like
more information.
Okay, so like
we'll go back here.
Uh so, you know, you know, you know, I
don't think you understood.
Uh to improve
narrow task decomposition,
we should be giving it
specific
considerations.
Oh, no, I didn't say it to do that yet.
Okay, we'll paste that in
as an example, right? So, I don't know
if it knows that's an example, but I
think it might know.
So, hopefully it understands cuz we're
talking about this this area here.
Um and if this fails, then we could just
again just make it it might even try to
change to EV, but we will see what
happens here.
Um and wait a moment and see what it
comes back with.
Okay, so
some of your examples general through
that Now, did it change it to EV stuff
or is it actually changing it to uh
a better part here. So, let's take a
look here.
So, what did it change?

[33:09]
Let's take a look here. So, here's what
changed. The domain EV. No, I didn't
want you to change the domain. I just
wanted you to use that as an example of
uh specific task decomposition.
Okay, so there it's already kind of
messed up and I had a feeling that it
would do that because I literally did
not put e.g. or stuff in there. And
maybe it's just that what we're trying
to do does not work for our use case.
Right? Maybe but it like I I still think
it is because you are doing research.
You're collecting information and and
gathering it, but we're just assuming
that we already have these things and
doing analysis on that information. But
uh you know, when you're doing broad
research and there's a lot of
information, then it can do do more
there. So, revert the domain name, but
we'll do self-reflection structure into
the hiring coordinator.
And so, we'll take a look at what it has
and maybe we still will do the EV
example separately.
I mean, it still has these in here. So,
I'm not sure what it was saying. I
should don't save cuz I'm not trying to
change that right now.
Yeah, so like you are a research
coordinator.
&gt;&gt; And uh I don't know if this is the way
that uh the topic makes money where uh
you tell something and it doesn't do the
right thing and
uh it's making more stuff here. But
we'll wait a little bit, okay?
All right, so it's back. And so, we say,
okay, um back to original domain right

[34:32]
in the pattern. What changed? Narrow
coordinator mirrors
the agent basic tells them all exactly
the three checks. Fix the pipeline, no
self-reflection. But that's not what I
want. Better coordination. Same domain,
same spokes. General initial screening
angles. What am I missing? Fill the
gaps.
And you know, I think I think it's
struggling here. Let's go back down
here. So, we'll go and take a look here
again.
Well, here we have the
narrow coordinator. So, it says here,
screen the uh the candidate by running
the following checks.
And then down below here we have better
coordinator. So, generate initial list
of screening angles. Ask yourself, what
perspective stakeholders or dimensions
are missing? Add screening angles to
cover those gaps. Only then begin
delegating to screening agent tool. For
hiring decisions, specifically consider
technical skills and soft skills, hard
requirements, what candidate has done
and etc. After all screening angles are
covered, synthesize report here. So, now
I would imagine that it's basically just
hitting a single agent. Yes, it is. And
so, before we had those separated out
tasks, right?
But just as I thought, it's like in
order to do it,
the idea is that you say you're you're
screening agent and then you are
contextualizing each one of it. So, in a
sense, each of these are basically
turning that into a specialized um

[35:55]
a specialized one as before we literally
had three separated one out.
Right? So, that I think that's what
we're getting at. So, that is what we
want. That's actually good. So, we'll go
all the way down here.
And what we'll do is we'll go It says
both the screen agent is identical both.
The only variable is the coordinator
prompt. So, with a uh hiring specific
checklist of what the coordinator
routinely uh looks for. So, let's go
ahead and run that. I believe that's
going to give us a better result. Okay,
so we'll go here.
We'll say, python main.py.
I'll run it.
so, here it's going through it. So,
and we're seeing the numbered values of
what it's checking for.
Does the resume demonstrate all the
required skills? Does the candidate
experience depth? Are there there any
red flags?
Has somebody else experience the
limited?
uh in the 5-8 senior range.
No employment gaps or job hopping
detected. The career directory is
logical etc.
Um and so, we have that there.
This is the narrow one, right? So, fixed
checklist, no gap check. Okay, so let's
go down to the more complex one.
So, we'll go down to this one. So, now
we have way more information. So,
instead of those three individualized
things,
um and remember there there was three
separate things before. Now, we have

[37:28]
um these I just want to compare the old
one quickly here cuz I just can't fully
remember.
We go here.
Yeah, notice that we have three
individualized prompts. And even with
the narrow one, I guess it's still only
passing it through those three. And so,
um that's interesting. But anyway,
So, here does the candidate demonstrate
mastery of etc. Okay, so we go down
I guess we can't really see the
individualized results. So, that would
be something that you might want to do
is like
output all of them and then save them
and then save the generated uh final one
to to exactly see what it is.
So, core stack matches excellent. Okay.
Risk and gaps.
Questions for interviews. Final Final
recommendation. Now, we have a maybe.
Alex is qualified candidate, but has
some gaps for a true senior role. Hire
if your team values this passive
whatever. Bottom line, Alex is a strong
back-end engineer. And then we have
coverage.
So, it's way better in terms of its
information. But really to test this,
you'd actually have to um
you know, create sample data, right? And
test it and then and then adjust and
say, hey look, uh this is not how I
would have judged it, right? Based on
that information. But this is the
example that we wanted, but really that
works when you know, there's a generic
research agent and then these
individualized things are going in and

[38:48]
kind of helping to specialize that
research agent for its task. Um but
yeah, that was cool.
All right, let's talk about dynamic
selection. So, the idea here is that
when you have your coordinator and you
have sub agents, um you might uh find
that if you run the entire pipeline for
every single possible spoke uh in a
sequence, that you are consuming as much
as you can. And so, with your
coordinator, you probably want to tell
it to think about what kind of passing
it needs or what kind of routing it
should have and give it ideas of kind of
routing that it can perform under
certain circumstances so that it's doing
exactly what it needs to do. Even here
it's saying like, you know, uh only
invoke it if it makes sense. Um and a
way we can catch that problem. So, if we
have a a poorly designed um
uh dynamic selection system, you can set
up a tool just like how we talked about
with the narrow task decomposition, you
could set up a tool that says, "Hey, did
you do a good job here?" You can do the
same thing with a tool as well.
and I mean, it's really going to depend
depend on what you're doing, but that's
something that you know, you you'll want
to consider, okay?
Hey folks, we are back and we are going
to try to do some dynamic selection. So,
um you know, for hours, uh our our job
application,
um basically, we are taking in
um information from from one thing, but
basically,
uh it's just checking everything. And

[40:18]
so,
you know, the question is like, can we
even think of any kind of select dynamic
selection that would be needed to be
performed for a job application? Because
I feel like it would be more if you were
to ask certain questions to the agent
along with this coordinator, then that's
where it would want to choose different
types of pathing. And so, I'm not
exactly sure. We'll let it help us
think of an idea, but I do want to
remind that we are just doing this to
learn. If you are doing this for real,
write these things by hand yourself. Use
your brain. That's how you're going to
get the best result. Garbage in means
garbage out. So, just cuz this thing
works, doesn't mean that this is
well-designed. We're just going through
this
uh to learn these concepts, right? Okay?
Um I'm not saying that this is the best.
But anyway, we'll go ahead here and make
a new folder. This one will be called
dynamic selection.
Okay, and I'm going to go ahead and make
a new main.py file.
And I'm going to go ahead
and select this code.
And we're going to copy this.
And we'll paste this
into here. And so, I need to give it a
concrete example of what we're talking
about for dynamic selection.
I do not have my text here. I put it in
there. I'm going to get uh ChatGPT to
extract it out just how we did with the
narrow narrow one. So, just ask it to
you know, extract out the text for me

[41:46]
here. I'm just doing this off-screen
here cuz I need to give it a practical
example
and try to describe what we're doing
here. We're going to CD back a couple
and we'll open that up.
And so, we'll go here and just say,
you know, I want to implement dynamic
dynamic selection
for my
so that it's
not running the entire pipeline,
but trying to choose
the best uh things to run based on use
Here is an example
of good
where we have
different pipelines.
You can use to uh help you.
Okay?
And the other thing is like, edit the
dynamic
selection main.py file. Okay. So, it's
going to go off and do that and uh we'll
see what it comes back with. Hopefully,
something that is useful. But, you know,
if we don't kind of guide and say like,
these are the use cases, you know,
I'm I'd be surprised if it doesn't come
back with anything good, but we will try
here
um just for learning purposes, okay?
All right, it's come back with
something. Let's take a look at what we
have.
Um so, dynamic coordinator. Oh, we still
have that narrow coordinator in there.
We should really remove that out of
there because it probably is confusing.
We now have like three coordinators. Um

[43:28]
I don't want to have three.
So, [snorts]
we'll go here. I'm just going to tell
like,
look, I I only need a single
coordinator prompt. So,
uh we'll
I'm being lazy here. If we don't need
the other ones, we can just delete them
out, right? We have this narrow one.
we know this one is not something we
want, so we'll take that out.
Then audits the gaps if we're delegating
specific domains.
And then here we have the dynamic one.
So, we'll take this one out.
Okay. Look at that. We wasted no tokens.
There's no reason we can't do that. We
don't have to prompt everything. Then
we'll go down here and take a look. So,
this coordinator reads the roles, then
decides which dimensions actually
matter. So, routing the logic.
So, strong technical match or whatever
whatever. Let's take a look and see what
we have.
So, routing guidance. Adapt to what you
observe. Don't apply mechanically. So,
simple factual match. Skip keyword scan.
Go to straight to this. Non-traditional
background. Transfer skills. Oh, this is
cool. I like this. Never invoke a
screening agent unless it's answers a
real question. So, I think that actually
um worked out perfectly.
That's a great example of of that. And
so, we'll go ahead here and I'm just
going to go and run it. So, we'll CD
into dynamic
selection.

[44:55]
This has actually been quite fun. Um is
it useful? I don't know. Depends on what
you're building.
And oh yeah, we don't have the narrow
coordinator. So, we'll go here and just
make sure narrow coordinator.
I want to get rid of these other ones. I
don't want to waste all that here.
And so, uh I'm just going to go back a
step and just say,
uh this should be fine. Let's just do
I didn't realize there's more to rip
out.
I think it'll still work though.
This is all three coordinators. There's
only one though, right? Because I ripped
them out.
So, here it says, "Describe the most
complex
screening angles delegated."
Okay. And the only the only way to
really know if this is different
What happened here?
Uh we have narrow QS. We still have some
of that remaining remaining code there.
So, it's just some of this stuff.
And so, I'll go ahead and try that
I'm not sure if that will work if it's
just a single item, but I'm hoping that
it does.
Um but here, um you know, my best guess
is that it's choosing exactly what it
needs cuz if we go back up to here,
that's what it looks like it's doing.
Oh my goodness. So, I'm going to go back
a directory here
um cuz this is very frustrating.
Uh remove the better
I only have a
single coordinator.

[46:39]
But, I remove some
of the other code
uh because I only really
need a single coordinator here.
Can you fix
fix the code?
You know what's funny is that sometimes
like I will type things and every single
letter will be wrong and it still knows
what I'm saying because it like it does
the off-shift, which I think is really
cool. As someone that's dyslexic, as
long as it understands me, I I love
that. Um
Yeah, and so, I'm just asking it to
clean it up. I just want to make sure
that it's in a working state before we
move on here.
All right. So, it thinks it's cleaned it
up. We'll go into here again.
And we'll run this again.
So, screening angles detected.
What I'm trying to determine when it
runs here is like, how is it selecting
stuff? So, in your current role at the
fintech, what is the scale of your
system that you worked on?
Your transmission from this. Have you
designed or refactored it?
So, what it looks like it's doing
is it's actually uh generating out uh
possible angles based on this
information. And so, it's literally
creating dynamic routing on the fly. So,
it's not like, here is a list
that we had before here, but literally
like, here are things that you can check
and then choose what you want to put in
here. So, it's not always applying the
same thing.

[48:01]
And we'll go back up to here.
It's still conditional maybe, but yeah,
we're getting something that is it's
again very interesting to see this play
Um again, you know, we don't know if
it's actually useful,
but it's fun to see the system working.
Um and there you go, okay?
Let's take a look at partitioning
research. So, if you give three research
agents the same brief, you get three
overlapping answers and wasted tokens.
So, if you're trying to paralyze things,
right and say, "Research CV market.
Research CV market." And they're all
doing the same thing, that's going to be
nonsense, right? So, carve up the scope
so each agent owns a distinct slice. And
so, here we are seeing partition
information where um we are creating
structured data and we're providing
detailed information like topic, cover,
excluded, things like that and providing
that information there. And as per
usual, we can create a tool that would
check and make sure that we're dividing
the research scope into non-overlapping
assignments before delegation. What's
really interesting here is that it's
making a structure.
Um and I mean, you know, in the last
thing that we did, technically it is
already kind of assembling um its own
way of doing stuff, but um I suppose
what we could do is we could generate
out into partitions
um in this sense and make sure that it's
even more detailed in terms of what it's
covering as an intermediate step um to
make sure that it's not doing the exact

[49:25]
same thing. But, this one's more focused
on very specific things that it's
researching.
Um but yeah, the question is like, does
our current one,
even if it's not the exact same one, is
it having overlapping tasks? And that's
what we don't know. And so maybe um
putting a structured structure a
structure with partitions might help.
But we'll have to experiment, okay?
Okay, so let's see if we can implement
partitioning in here.
So what I'm going to do is make a new
folder here called research
partitioning.
Partitioning.
And we'll go ahead and make ourselves
another new main.py file. We're having
lots of fun here. And so we'll grab this
wasn't this one this is the last one we
worked on, right?
Going to grab this here.
Copy it.
go all the way down.
And oh wait, no no no this one's empty.
Here we go. Okay. So now we are back
with our dynamic one. So here we have uh
off screen here I just told it to
extract it out.
Right? And
um I'm going to just say here like, you
know, I want to make sure I want to make
sure
my
uh research
what are they called?
What did they call them here?
My research agent
agents aren't wasting credits

[50:54]
uh tokens by having
and time by having uh overlapping
And so I would like to have another
step
where we have uh partitions.
And I mean like the thing is like you
could manually make this stuff, but I'd
rather just generate it out so it makes
it easier for us. So we have partitions
uh uh
have a
step where we generate out
partitions
based on a JSON structure.
And then we can determine
if there is
if they are
truly not
doing the same task.
Make sure to print out
the structure so the human can uh see it
on the run of the coordinator agent.
Update the
research partitioning main.py and here
is an example
of partitioning
from a different use case.
Okay. And so I'm going to copy this
over.
Bring it on over here.
Right? And I'm hoping that this will
work.
Right? But I mean like this could also
could just be like a static way. Like if
you were just statically building a
research agent
that this would be a means to which you
could do it and you don't have to
delegate so much out to the agent if you
will. But then now we're kind of relying

[52:42]
more on
code driven logic. But you can mix them
by the way. We didn't We didn't mention
that, but you can take a hybrid approach
where some of it is the coordinator and
some of it is code driven. There's
nothing wrong with it. There's no rules
here, folks.
There's no 100% bad. It's what you want
to do, right? Um and so we will see if
it can come up with something here and
then we will review that code, okay?
Okay, let's take a look and see what it
thinks it's doing here. So
uh narrow We still got this language
like narrow versus better. I probably
should get that out of there.
Mhm mhm mhm. I really should be taking
this out so that uh it's not getting as
complicated
here. So screening agent prompt You are
a specialist hiring analyst. You will be
given specific screening uh questions
about a candidate. Answer the questions
two to three focus sentences. Be
concrete and specific. So really changed
it in this case.
Oh no no, this is fine. This is still
the same.
Runs a specialized agent, calls once per
screening, etc. etc.
I don't want Oh, I do not want multiple
agents. Look, I don't want more more
than one coordinator.
Uh
we don't need
the narrow
coordinator, okay? And so it's just
because we copied it and I had some of
the code still lying around and that's

[54:13]
what's Oh, no no no no no no no no no no
no.
I just realized I was editing the wrong
file.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I went back there and I'm going
to make sure I didn't muck that one up.
Uh yeah, I don't want to muck with this
one.
Oh now I don't know.
Did I break it good?
I think I can just go ahead here and
discard the changes. I think it'll be
fine.
Okay. And so we'll go over to here and
this is the one we actually wanted.
And so it still has that logic in here
which is kind of a problem, but I will
see if it actually is an issue.
Cuz we only have one, right? And I'm
just going to remove it. I just don't
want it to get confused.
And I don't want to explain any of that
here. So I'm just going to take that
So let's take a look here.
Says for both coordinators. So spoke
system prompts. I'm just going to take
that out.
It keeps talking about like
And now let's take a look here. So you
are a partitioning uh a screen
partitioning planner given a job posting
resume. Output a JSON array of non
overlapping screen partitions. Each
partition object must have an agent, a
scope.
Um rules design partitions so that
together they cover all relevant hiring
questions. No two partitions may share
the same cover uh cover aspect. Only
include partitions that are genuinely

[55:56]
needed for this candidate. I feel like
uh we lost uh information here.
We have
Oh this is the planner part. Okay, so
this is actually a separate part. Okay,
so that just generates the partition,
all right? And then down below here
we have
the actual dynamic coordinator. So you
you're here invoke exactly one screen
partition call per partition, no more or
less. Formulate the questions for each
cell. Do not invent additional screening
angles beyond the partitions provided.
They were designed to cover all relevant
dimensions without overlap. And so I
mean like that's another way where it's
just
specifying it in a different
way, but I guess it's generating out the
partitions.
So in the other one we literally listed
out possible things and here it's
generating them out. Oh here it is.
Is this good?
Because before we had a list, right? So
if we go back over to our
um we'll just put this for a second.
And we go back to our dynamic selection
Right? And so here
we had this, but we lost our routing
guidance.
So this is what I'm going to ask.
I'm going to resume the last
conversation we had.
Going to make this a bit larger here.
No. So does it We don't have it anymore,
unfortunately. Or maybe I ran into a
subfolder and that's my problem. So I'm
going to go here and ask it like

[57:43]
We have uh we have a dynamic
What is it that we have? We have a
research partition
so that we don't have uh overlapping
researchers doing the same thing.
Did we lose
selective routing
based on task? Uh
and do we need to
bring that back in
while preserving
our partitioning?
Okay. And so I'm going to go point to
has the original
prompt that had routing.
And then here we have research
partitioning
is our um
new prompt with partitioning.
But the routing was removed.
And so
how would it know
to do
routing?
Like do like how would it know
to
choose the appropriate
dynamic selection?
Okay. And so that's where I think
there's a bit of an issue.
Okay? Because sure, like we now it will
generate out that structure and things,
but how does it know to drive what to
generate?
Cuz it doesn't say that, right?
And so dynamic both selects the angles,
matters, and delegates. It has routing
that skips the scan and strong matches.
Now owns the selection step, but it has
no routing rules. It just generates

[59:37]
non-overlapping partitions without
guidance which
on which one will skip.
And so here
I'm just going to hit tab here.
Okay, you are moving it
back in, but are you thinking about
how it will work
or you're just dumping it back in?
Because I could have done that.
That doesn't mean that's a smart
approach.
And maybe that's all we need to do.
But let's take a look and see what it
comes up with.
I'm telling you these things aren't
smart, folks. You've got to
think for it. So here we go. Fair point.
Let me think about it. So we have
partitioning that sees the resume and
then the dynamic coordinator which sees
the partitions. Where does the routing
actually live now? So dynamic selection
the coordinator was doing two of one
things, deciding what to check and
calling agents. Uh and the research
partitioning now splits routing
partition planner
planner's job and then the coordinator's
job. So the routing rules do belong
to the partitioning planner, but they
need to be reframed. In the original one
it says never invoke the rules unless
here we should say only create partition
if the rules govern partition creation.
The coordinator in the new architecture
should stay as is. It's correct to be
dumb selection because the decision was
already made upstream.
Uh giving it routing logic again would

[01:01:11]
create a conflict of two places fighting
over what gets evaluated. Um the
partition planner currently says only
include the partition genuinely needed.
That's vague. Adding a specific
heuristic routing. I mean like I would
have thought
and you might agree with me is that
in the dynamic coordinator we had that
list.
Uh but the thing is is like it was
saying like okay, if you do this then
then do this or do that, but maybe the
the problem was is that when we looked
at the EV research, it literally had
pipelines where in this dynamic router
it just had things that you could choose
from that you might want to consider.
Okay, but it wouldn't run them all.
So here it says we receive a set of
pre-planning partitions as JSON.
Invoke exactly one screening agent.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well let's just see what we get.
I'm not sure if I like it, but
we're trying here, right?
And we'll go main.py and we'll run it.
And see what happens.
So we have we have
core stack proficiency.
Assess REST API capabilities.
Okay, so we have here
um core stack proficiency. Evaluate
mastery of required technologies
directly matching the job stack.
Uh-huh. Access REST API design
capabilities.
Evaluate exposure to scaling patterns
and nice-to-have technologies. Confirm
senior-level experience.

[01:03:02]
And then here we have screening angles
delegated. Does the candidate
demonstrate mastery of required stuff?
Uh okay.
And here we're getting partials. So we
have a maybe recommendation. Alex is
qualified to mid to senior.
And we have different coverage. So I
still don't know this is better. I mean
like we should be dumping all these logs
out and then comparing them and then and
doing stuff. So obviously we were just
trying to meet the requirements of
learning this stuff and kind of having a
sense of it, but is it good? Is it is
another question that will take more
time and I'm going to keep repeating
that because I just want you to know
just cuz we're doing it doesn't mean
it's great.
And you should be thinking about like
okay, if I had these three four
different ways um you know, determine
usage, determine outcomes, have your
examples. Don't have them for you here.
That'd be a lot of work for me to set up
for you. Um but uh yeah, it's
interesting trying to try out these
techniques and apply them, okay?
Let's take a look at a refinement loop.
So the idea right now is that um
everything's been one shot. The idea is
it goes through it, it produces an
evaluation and then then it's over. But
what if we could feed it back in the
loop and refine it until we are happy
with it and that's the idea behind a
refinement loop to make our research
system really really good.
Um so if you look at this prompt here

[01:04:22]
for our coordinator the idea here is
that we are telling it that we can have
up to maximum four refinement iterations
and that we are going to delegate the
information back into here. And so
you'll notice here we have like an
evaluation coverage and when to submit
final uh and uh
uh creating the synthesis and things
like that. And so we will go ahead and
try to apply refinement loop to our um
our agent, okay?
Hey folks, this is Andrew. In this video
we're going to implement our own
refinement loop. Uh so what we'll do as
per usual, I'm going to go ahead and
make a new folder. This will be my
refinement
loop.
Okay. And then what we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead. Let's just grab
our code here, main.py. We're going to
go grab our last one which was research
Cuz we're building off of it every
single time trying to make this thing a
little bit better. And we are going to
implement the refinement loop. I need to
extract the text out because again I I
don't have it on on hand, but let me go
grab it from that slide, okay?
There we go. I grabbed it. And if you
want to grab it, too, all you got to do
is take a screenshot, feed it to Claude
or ChatGPT and extract it out, folks. Um
because you can. You can. Make sure you
do that, okay? It's not hard. Just
build up those skills, okay?
So I'm going to go ahead here and just
CD out here. We're going to go into our
Claude. And um you know, I need to

[01:05:54]
implement a refinement loop
uh in my agent for
research
partitioning main. Here is uh a example
from another
use case
you can use as inspiration.
As guidance.
Okay. And so I'm going to paste that in
there. And so the idea though is that
with that information
I'm hoping that it can develop that
refinement loop in here. So we will see
what it produces, okay?
All right. So in here we have um
changes. Let's take a look and well it's
still trying to edit stuff. So yes.
and let's see
uh what we have. Okay, so it is bringing
um evaluate coverage. Okay, so we have
Uh submit final. So it's setting
different states based on whether
you know, higher maybe or pass. Only
call this when the evaluation confirms
uh sufficient coverage.
And final recommendation. So we have
that in our loop.
Here it is adding the evaluation agent,
And we have some tweaks here. So we have
initial screening. Invoke exactly one
screening agent call per partition.
Formulate each question. That's fine.
Phase two, evaluate coverage. After all
initial partitions agents have reported
call evaluation coverage with plain
text.
And here we have refinement max three
iterations. If the evaluation coverage
returns sufficient false
invoke screening agents to fill only

[01:07:36]
identified gaps.
Uh call submit final etc. etc. Do not
call the submit final before evaluation
uh if it's only once, okay? So here is
obviously done a lot. I'm kind of
curious to think like maybe it's just
like you're brute forcing to make it
either that you really want this person
or you really don't want this person.
It'd be interesting to have a larger
data set like let's say 100 applicants
and you ran it through and to see if it
just skewed it to one location or or one
side or not. Um but it'd be very
interesting to find out, but we'll go
back up to
here and so we can see the changes.
And let's go and run this thing.
Notice as we are progressing it's
becoming easier and easier for us to
update our agent. And so far we've been
just using the Anthropic um SDK not
using the agent SDK. The agent SDK is
awesome, but uh
we will just continue on here. It'd be
interesting to convert it over and see
what the code looks like and we'll
probably do that. Um but let's go ahead
and do python main.py and we'll go ahead
and run that. And the idea it's going to
run it says dynamic coordinator.
Obviously it's the refinement one. We
don't change those names. And so here
reads candidates first, routes to the
relevant checks only. So evaluate depth.
Access to database caching. Verify API.
Confirm senior-level experience.
is the candidate senior level? Okay,
great. So now we're going into iteration
So we have coverage score, code quality

[01:09:06]
practices, no evidence etc. etc. And so
it is going again here.
Asking questions.
They are I think they are different
questions.
It's hard to be because we have the this
up here, right? And then down below
Oh look, the the coverage score is going
down now. Interesting.
And so we are done and over with.
We'll go and uh look up here. So did two
iterations.
And their score went down.
So yeah, that's iteration loop. Is that
good? I don't know. It takes a lot of
work to evaluate this stuff. We would
spend hours hours upon hours tweaking
to figure out is this valuable
information? Is our data set good? Etc.
etc.
There's no magic here, folks. We can
uh code these out very quickly, but to
make sure they actually work good is a
different story. I'm going to keep
repeating that because it's true. Uh but
that is what the refinement look uh
refinement loop looks like, okay?
Okay, folks. Let's take take a look at
observability. So the idea of having
this centralized coordinator is the fact
that everything's going to pass through
it, okay? So no matter who has to talk
to who, it's going to pass that
coordinator. And because of that, um the
coordinator is at a choke point where it
can observe um anything and catch any
kind of errors because it is
coordinating stuff. But when you uh do
not have that, then everyone is just
communicating with each other and you

[01:10:40]
can't observe what was said. You can't
catch errors consistently. You can't
control what information crosses
boundaries. But the coordinator can do
all those things. And so we are using
the coordinator pattern.
Um do we have observability? That's a
good question. So I would say let's go
back to our thing and see uh if it is
working. I would probably ask like,
"Hey, can it actually wrote to other
ones and is it capturing information?"
I know it already probably is working
this way, but let's confirm and go back
to our code, okay?
Hey folks, we are back and I'm going to
make a new folder and this will be uh
coordinator observability.
Because the idea here
is that our coordinator should act as an
observable layer. And so I want to make
sure that it actually is doing that. So
let's go
back here.
And we'll uh
uh go into um Well, we'll type cloud
here, right? And we already have the
refinement loop over here. So I'm going
to go ahead and grab all this code.
Okay, I'm going to grab all this code
and we'll make a new file called
main.py. You're starting to get the
pattern here what we're doing, right?
Very repetitive, but it really is good
in iteration. So um what I want to
figure out is do we actually have those
values? Is the coordinator acting like a
coordinator? So um
I'm just thinking about this for a
second. So what we want to do,

[01:12:03]
so we're going to say uh I have an agent
uh a coordinator agent
uh here. So we'll say uh coordinator
observability.
Here, I'm going to put this in a plan
mode. Here are the questions I have. Is
my coordinator
operating from observability level?
Observability and
I'm trying to think of what like and
controlling controlling flow of
information.
Uh you know,
is it uh
managing, you know, like is it I'm
trying to think like here. I have a
coordinator agent, right?
Here are the questions I have. Is my
coordinator operating operating from uh
uh operating
with an observability layer?
So we can capture
uh any errors.
All messages that that that are being uh
sent to our spokes.
Sub agents.
Is it controlling
context in what is passed
uh to my um
uh spokes
and only those sub agents
can talk to the coordinator.
Is there something I am missing
to make my coordinator
a good coordinate coordinator, right?
That's what we want to know. And we'll
go ahead and hit plan there. You're
thinking, "Well, you know,
you're just writing whatever out." But
that's that's a fine problem. You can't

[01:14:02]
make perfect prompts here, folks.
I mean, you can make better prompts
yourself and spend time engineering
them, but this is good enough to start
getting some information. So let's see
what it comes back with. And I'd be
curious to uh layer something here uh
there. So I'm just curious what we can
do
um to make our observability better.
Um but we will wait for that generation,
Okay, so let's take a look and see what
it thinks.
Um So we'll go all the way to the top
here. So
the user's coordinator uses a
partition-based hub-spoke pattern for
job screening. They want to know, does
it have proper observability? Does it
capture all messages to spoke? Does it
control context passed to spokes? Is Is
the spoke-coordinator communication
isolated? What is missing to be a good
coordinator? So it says observability is
weak. I absolutely agree. We haven't
done anything for it. Um
Could we do something better than just
Oh, yes, it's only print statements. I
agree with that. Um
uh error handling anywhere it says JSON
loads. Yeah, that makes sense. API level
tracing. No token counts. No latency. No
request IDs. Yeah, token counts would be
really useful.
Uh no persistent audit trail of all
output and ephemeral stdout. We have
message capture partial. So delegate
list. We are printing some stuff, right?
Cuz I told it to do that, but um
Tracks questions sent to spokes. Spokes

[01:15:20]
responses are never stored. They go
straight into the tool results and are
lost out of the coordinator. No record
of partition each question uh uh
addressed X. No log of coordinator's own
reasoning text between tool calls. Mhm.
Every spoke receives the full job
posting.
And so it's saying context control
loose. Resume regardless of its
partition.
I mean, it would need it anyway, right?
Like all of them need it. So we're not
really giving them separate data.
Uh regardless of its partition scope.
So cover exclude is only advisory passed
by JSON to the coordinator prompt, but
not enforced at the spoke level.
Uh the coordinator uh could ask any
question. No mechanism validates the
question stays within the uh assigned
Fair enough. Spoke isolation one
direction one directional enforce. So
spokes are stateless functions called by
the coordinator. No cross no cross spoke
communication. So that's good. But
spokes have no awareness of their
assigned partitions. They can't reject
out of scope questions. Oh, that's
actually a good good point. No
uh only these spokes can talk to
coordinator mechanism is just a single
plane one. So where are gaps? Can't
debug or audit the run. Silent crashes
on failures. Can't replay or inspect
what's wrong. Coordinator doesn't know
if all dimensions are covered mid run.
Recommendation may be issued before all
uh angles are addressed. Spokes are all
data even if relevant. All partitions

[01:16:49]
even if some obviously irrelevant. A
single pass cannot fill gaps during it.
And also our data like if I'm really if
we maybe want to make this better, we
would be sending like different payloads
of different information to specific
research agents. But right now
everyone's getting the same job posting.
Um So here they have recommend fixes so
structured logging with timestamp
levels.
That seems good. Uh that's fine, sure.
And it's going to log that out. Error
handling. So wrap the JSON load.
Generate the partition.
Uh persist spoke inputs outputs so
extend beyond the tracking.
Add coverage evaluation tool at at
explicit gates.
Force the coordinator to call submit
final.
And so these are fine.
The
only challenge here is I don't I feel
like there's a lot of tasks here. So I'm
just going to go here and say,
"There is a lot of am concerned
uh you will
uh not be able to remember all the
Can you create
this uh plan in a readme with a task
checklist?
And can you
check off
the tasks
as you complete them?"
Okay. And so the goal there is to help
it out a bit. Um that's not exactly
spec-driven development, but the only
thing is like if we really wanted this

[01:18:15]
to drive and be really good, we would
want something that would clear context
each time. But we're not set up that
way. I'm not here to roll a a small
spec-driven development little thing for
us here. So that's totally fine.
And um
readme with tasks and checklist.
As long as it knows what it's doing
that, that's fine. But where's it going
to put that file?
Yeah, I'm just going to trust that it
can do it.
Let's go ahead and let her rip.
Okay? Um and so the idea again here is
to improve observability and we will
uh see how that goes. Another thing is
like I would imagine that if you were to
put this into production, you want to
productionize it, you might want to
contain these sub agents into
containers. And then you might want to
use Otel
as another observability layer.
That's how I'm kind of thinking about
it.
But we're keeping it all monolith for
now and we're not going to overly
complicate it at this stage. Um and I'm
going to let it go and burn away all my
credits. Look at that. 6.2 thousand
credits. Wow. Let's go over here. It's
like the worst time to do this. People
are like there's a on Twitter they're
like, "Oh, it's down." And the usages
are gone and stuff like that. It's me.
It's me. I'm the I'm the problem.
So go over here and right off the bat
like we are
Oh, resets in 9 minutes though, that's

[01:19:34]
really good. But we're only 33% Well,
let's burn, burn, burn, baby. Though my
week is is is getting up to use very
quickly there. Um but anyway,
Oh, yeah, it's it's going up. So, yeah,
we're going to consume tokens like it's
nobody's business.
Um but I think it'll be worth it for
this stage of the thing as we are
continually refining it, okay?
Uh that was fast. I feel like it should
have taken longer than that. All six
fixed fixes are implemented. I mean, I
would rather have been more granular and
clearing contacts between it so that we
would have um
you know,
better stuff. Well, that's fine. So, is
my coordinator operating with
observability? No, it had only print
statements, etc., etc. What was I
missing? Error handling, mid-run gap
detection, no exit gate. And I'm not
even saying like this is the best, but
um you know, it's pretty good for
us throwing things here together. Let's
see if we can see what I mean, it
probably will just tell us what code
changes were made.
I suppose that's the easiest way to
check.
I'm just going to go all the way up
here. Let's take a look here. So, we've
added logging, okay?
And we are implementing the logger.
Here, it says scope to each partition.
Partition agent name uh is the names the
question belongs to from the partition
JSON. Okay, so it's being very
particular to make sure that it's

[01:20:57]
scoped. That's good. Evaluate coverage.
So, mid-run gap detection tool. Evaluate
whether the screening finds are
efficient to make a confident
recommendation.
Um confident that all partitions agents
have reported. Return a coverage score,
etc., etc.
Okay, submit final explicit exit gate.
Submit the final hiring recommendation
only this
Call this only after evaluate coverage.
So, go down below here.
Mhm. Fix error handling.
So, here we have
Here's down the error handling down here
below. Fair enough. That's very basic.
That's not really that important.
And then we have the screening agent.
So, we are seeing
Oh, to scope it in the boundary, right?
So, making sure that it's scoped.
Here we have rule changes.
And so, it's about passing that
information and it's talking about that
evaluation coverage in the final
Okay. And then we got logs, logs.
And more logic. Now, this thing is
pretty wild. I would probably want to
take it farther and refactor it, but I
don't really want to uh
Like this is just this is a mess. Like
this is not how you should have your
code base. But I don't want to go
overboard at this stage. I just want to
make sure that this works.
Okay, so what we're going to do cuz I'm
expecting logging to appear, right?
And so, I would probably say like we
could just run it.

[01:22:48]
But the other challenge would be like we
need actual ways to test that the stuff
works. So, probably what would have been
better
but it would have taken a lot like this
would have took an hour or two and you
folks don't want to wait around that
long to test that. But what I would have
done if we had the time and you wanted
to go through it, what I would do is I
would stage
examples and and and I would want to see
if like we could pollute um
pollute the context between agents and
make sure that it is only receiving
proper questions and it rejects it and
those would be things that we test for.
So, we really are skipping a lot of that
stuff and that's stuff that you would
still have to do. But just because I'm
not doing it here doesn't mean that I
wouldn't do it. Um it's just I'm not
doing it because you folks don't like
when I make like two, three-hour videos.
Um even though that's the actual effort
for the work and I can't really just
you know, fake that along, right? So,
we'll go ahead and we'll run that. I
think it's spelled observability wrong,
which is fine. And so, what I'm
interested in is do we get any logging?
Where is our logging? I don't see it.
I mean, it's just going to ST out. So,
it's not logging to anywhere in
particular.
Which is fine. Uh so, I you know, I'd
probably just have it log to like into
in a log directory and that's
the only thing that might be missing
And I'm just going to wait for it to run

[01:24:24]
Oh, there we go. There it's done.
And so, we have our final information.
Did it call that final evaluation step?
Yeah, final recommendation. There it is.
So, there you go. That's all it took to
improve it.
Definitely better than what we had
before.
Um but yeah, I would probably want to
refactor this so that's
like you shouldn't have one big dumb
file like this. Um and so, we might do
that in a separate video. Especially if
we want to convert it over to the agent
SDK to compare. That might be something
we might want to do, okay? Um but yeah,
now we've added observability.
Hey folks, it's Andrew and in this
video, what I want to do is I want to
refactor our coordinator that we've been
working on up to this point as I'm going
to want to port it over maybe to agent
SDK to just take a look and see what
that looks like. And so, we're just
going to say
um uh coordinator
refactor here.
And I'm going to go ahead and grab the
code here.
And we are going to ask it
to refactor.
Um and let's just see if we can make
this a little bit more maintainable,
okay? If you are not a programmer, you
might not know that this is not good
code.
Okay? And it like it works for this
point that we've been able to hold this
all into memory, but if we came back
later, we wouldn't be able to really

[01:25:42]
make sense of it. And just because the
agent can make sense of it and summarize
it to it, that's not good enough. We
need to make it so that it is more
human-readable
um and that is what we are going to do.
So, I'm just going to CD out of here and
we're going to go into Claude. And
uh we are going to get some refactoring
going on. So, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make a new file called
refactor.
refactor
MD. And I'm going to go say refactor
um tasks.
So, this is this document um is the
tasks I want completed to refactor
uh this uh
our
coordinator agent.
Uh currently,
all code sits in the main.py and we need
to uh
break it into
multiple files.
So, uh let's go ahead and start making
some tasks. I'm just going to make my
observations of
what I don't like. So, the first thing
is um
the prompt. So,
all prompts should be uh stored
as um
All prompts should be stored All prompts
should be stored as markdown files
in a prompts
directory.
Okay? So, that's step number one. The
other thing is like tools. See how tools
is very uh wieldy? So, uh tools should

[01:27:23]
be
uh individually
defined as their own files in the tools
We should have .py files for each actual
tool code.
And the
tools.
The tools
I mean, like can we this is JSON, right?
can we? I don't think there's anything
special about this and the
um tools.json
for the long tool.
Right? I I think it will understand what
that is for the uh
gets passed
to create. So, that is definitely
something I would like fixed.
What else? What else?
Do your partitions.
We do have the partition system.
So, say partition uh generation
should be
in lib
as its own file. That's something else I
would do.
Um that's a function that is that. Run
The logging is inconsistent. I don't
like how the logging is. So,
we should have a logger that um
refactors
all the logs to be consistent in a file
in a file called logger
in our logger.py
in our uh
lib directory.
That'd be another thing I would want.
Yeah, so I think that's a start.
And so I'm going to go ahead and just
say uh

[01:29:33]
I want you to refactor
my code base on
that markdown file's
tasks for the
main.py in the
coordinator refactor, okay? And so we
will let it go do that
and we'll see if we can really reduce
and organize that code base cuz it
really should be really easy for us to
read. Right? Like I know we can make
sense of it because we've been carrying
forward it, but we really need to be at
100% like yes, absolutely, I know what
I'm looking at, okay?
So I'm just going to accept everything
that goes along here and then we will
take a look and see what we have. So
it's already off to the races. We have
our prompt, our partition planner, our
screening uh agent.md. For me like I
would probably want these to be
templates that you can inject stuff
into, but there's no reason for that
right now. We don't really need dynamic
injection, but it's definitely something
that would be uh interesting to do. We
have our tools directory. I think we
only have the one agent here and then we
have our tools JSON, so that is uh
working out pretty well so far. It's
going pretty quick, too. Man, these
things are getting really, really
better. Here we have our logger and then
we are going to have our partitions.py.
I really don't like that we have
constants. I do not like using constants
whatsoever. I think they're just it's
just bad, bad code. Um but we'll
continue on here and

[01:30:55]
uh check it out in a moment. I'm going
to just check how my usage is going.
And uh you doesn't matter, it just
reset. I'm back at 2%. Look at that.
Lucky me, eh?
So we are just chilling out here waiting
for this to generate.
I'm going to pause here and we will
come back in a moment.
I think it might be done. I didn't even
really wait that long. And so we'll go
up here and take a look.
And so we have our main.py, we have our
prompts, we have our tools, we have our
libs. Let's go take a look here and see
if this is reduced enough.
Okay, and
I probably should have told it to check
box off these.
Uh which is fine.
So I'll just go here and just check them
off myself.
I just didn't feel like telling it to do
that. I don't know.
I assumed it would be fine.
I could also ask it like hey, is there
anything else that we could do to
refactor to make it more human readable?
But I don't feel like it would know cuz
it's not a human.
And then it's trained on garbage repos.
Okay, so let's go into our main,
wherever that is. Hold on here, our
main.
And I I usually just have a sense of
like is this readable, right? Um
it's still yuck. It's really, really
long.
So there's still some stuff in here that
needs to be refactored. We'll go over to

[01:32:29]
So say coverage report.
Coverage report should be its own
file in lib
called coverage report.
The other thing is like the data, so
right now we have hard-coded data.
Make a
data folder and store data artifacts
and load them into the app.
Okay. That's another thing. Um
I really dislike the logging.
Yeah, and we have the trace append.
It's still very, very verbose.
And there are still things that's like
I'm noticing here like
There are
There are templates for
content for messages
that should really
be uh templated uh files
that take variables.
And load it in.
Maybe um
Okay, like is that a prompt? I mean like
we have this, it's technically a prompt.
So technically technically they are
prompts.
Our prompts for content.
And so uh prompts
So move them.
Them to prompts folders.
So there's that. There's a lot of those.
Okay, and so we'll go back here, we'll
save the file.
Um all the way down to here.
There are new tasks in the refactor.
md, okay? And so we're going to have it
go off and do those tasks.
And so we'll give it a moment there. I'm
going to pause and I mean I really

[01:35:23]
should tell it to check them off. I
didn't tell it to do that. Uh but we'll
come back and take a look and then we'll
ask it to do a general refactor. I'm
still like I really don't like this.
Like we see how we have like double
lines and stuff like that. I don't need
that kind of level logging. Um but I
would have to explain to it um why
that's an issue.
Yeah, it's still just making them md
files. It's not marking them whether
they're templates or not, but we'll just
treat them as templates.
And here we're getting a lot more in
here, so that's better.
But I I just know what good code looks
like and I I know that's not good code.
Um but there's only so much you can do
with Python.
Certain languages have um
the ability to have better readability
like Ruby's really, really good at that.
I'd love to port this over to Ruby. I
just didn't check if the agent SDK is
available. I don't think it is available
in Ruby. I just think that the Anthropic
one is and so if the agent SDK was in
Ruby, I would absolutely be using it
over uh the Python one as I really do
not like Python code and um it do it
just you just can't get it to be
extremely human readable. Um
unfortunately we are all kind of using
it because of the way the industry is.
Um as they've adopted it, not because
it's good, just because of mass adoption
in the uh
data data science and stuff like that.
So it just became de facto. Oh look,

[01:36:34]
it's already done. And so we have uh
that there and so we will again look at
the main file. I'm just going to close
it and reopen it. Sometimes it doesn't
always show me right away.
It didn't check box these off. I really
should tell it to check box them off
when it does that. So we'll go ahead and
save that. We'll go back over to our
main.py and we'll scroll up. And I get
I'm looking that looking at this for uh
for refactorability.
I would say like they haven't done a
good job with logging, so I'd say
you haven't done a good job refactoring
the logging, right? So for example
we have log log info partition like
partition
uh you should be making
helper functions.
Uh so these logs
e.g. like log partition.
Um or you know, like log right? Log warn
and they will add
uh the you know
tags. The uh other thing is
um you have superfluous
logging that is great for
human readability.
But we want to
focus on logging
good for
for uh logs. And
uh we should be outputting
logs to a log folder relative to the uh
folder
of this agent.
Okay, and so that you know, that's one
thing that's really bothering me.
I really hate constants, so that'll be

[01:38:31]
another thing that we fix here in just a
moment.
But again, we're just trying to get this
to be in shape. Um
Did it also move this out of here? Like
what's this big thing? Like why is the
tool used so large here?
And while that is thinking, let's go
review our other parts of code.
Okay, I mean this is fine.
I think I wouldn't mind if we had like
this is a big JSON object, but I
wouldn't mind if we had a shorter syntax
for this. I don't want to do that right
now because it's totally possible that
uh we will be able to do that in agent
SDK where it probably already has like a
shorthand to make that code smaller. And
so I don't want to uh
uh muck with that.
And we'll look at the partition here.
Really hate those those constants.
And also I I really dislike how it's
loading in the prompt template. So there
should be a way to uh
manage that.
Look look at all this logger logic. Oh,
no, that's the logger file.
Yeah, here now we're starting to get
those things that I that I was asking
for. That's good.
The other thing that that's And I mean
we don't need to do this, but like
technically, you know, we have all these
subagents that are calling create. We
could technically delegate them out to
different models if we needed to.
Um or we could even say like, "Hey, can
you try to choose the best model as it's
working through there?" But yeah, I

[01:40:07]
guess the next thing on my task is to
fix that um
Like I'm not updating the refactor. We
could keep updating that as a means to
keep uh keep track of stuff, but I just
don't care.
Yeah, I want to fix those constants.
And I want to get something that loads
in the templates.
I'm just going to take a look here at
our usage.
9% doing okay over here.
Okay. And so now that is uh fixed up.
We'll take a look here. Again, I'm
looking at my main seeing if it's
shorter.
Yeah, it's looking Yeah, this is way
less messier.
I don't like using constants.
EG like
this is a var. Please don't use these
in the folder for the coordinator
refactor. Fix the code.
Okay, so that's something I really
dislike.
And so we will get that improvement
This This to me is like there's a big
issue with the loop. So I feel that we
need to give it a better instructions on
like how to better refactor the loop. I
mean it's using just a big
if self
block. There might be some kind of uh
state flow machine or something that
could improve that loop. Um as I'm not
happy about it. Before we do that, I
want you to fix the template reading and
loading of files.
And so there it's just making basic
changes for names.

[01:41:46]
Right there. So those are getting
changed. Good.
And it'll be done here in probably just
a moment. Yeah, it's just updating the
main.py and then we will
have those fixed. Come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
And also like loading these templates
and populating them probably needs to be
its own thing. Yeah, great. Thanks.
Okay. Another thing is uh loading
loading files and templates where you uh
inject
variables.
Um you can
make a new uh uh uh template template um
template file in the
uh lib directory.
And this
should
uh refactor
having
you know, large
load
code EG like this. Okay. And so that's
another thing that's kind of bothering
me. So we will get that cleaned up as
well.
There's other things like this. Like see
how this is like something's happening
here. So that should be refactored out
into a function.
Uh like everything here. Like just the
units of code is is just not
explainable.
So the run coordinator definitely needs
to be broken up into tons of functions.
Every single of these if else blocks
should be functions.
And I would probably prefer stateless

[01:43:27]
classes. I really prefer stateless
classes as that makes it really easy to
track inputs and outputs of stuff. Um
And Python's pretty good for that
because of the way it defines uh these
label tags. I can't remember what
they're called. The prop named
properties.
And so that will be good.
I'm making a lot of changes here. So
there's a high chance this might not
work, but that's fine.
Uh we can always work through that.
Uh it's fine. You're fine, Claude.
You're fine.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so now that that's loaded. I'm
not sure if uh that actually changed.
We'll go back over to here.
And so with that, now when it needs it,
I feel Yeah, like load prompt exactly
like this.
So yeah, the big problem still is the
run coordinator.
So the run coordinator
file is giant.
Uh we should refactor
into a stateless
uh uh a stateless function.
all the parts of code
uh should be chunked
into functions.
So the functions basically
act as documentation.
You know, for example, the contents of
if if uh if blocks are really
uh should be uh function calls, right?
We'll go ahead and we'll see if it
understands what I'm trying to say. But
like when you write good code,
you know, like this would be a function.

[01:45:04]
This would be a function. This would be
a function. Um
whatever this is.
Right? These if blocks. And we'll see if
it understands what I'm talking about.
But I feel like that's a really
important component. In fact, this run
coordinator could also be in the lib
directory. Um and we might suggest it to
move that in a moment. But right now I
want to see if it could even handle what
I'm asking it to do. It might not
understand. Uh cuz if I don't have like
an example, it's just not going to know
what I'm trying to ask for. Again,
checking my coverage here. Uh we're at
11% usage. Some folks were suggesting
that like when it's high peak usage, it
depends on like if you overlap with
Europe European time. I'm not uh
obviously in Europe. And so um they said
like just try a bit later when
everyone's sleeping. And it's way later.
So uh you know, it would be maybe um
off-peak usage time. But anyway, we'll
just wait here and see what happens.
It's back with functions. And again, we
could call plan to ask it to do this
before, but I I don't really care that
much. So we have plan partitions,
validate index partitions, run. I've
seen something like with partition
information. I'm almost wondering if
that should be really part of the
partitions.py.
Right? Um
log coordinator reasoning, handle this
information. And so those partition
ones, there's three with partition ones.
Right? And so we'll go over to here.

[01:46:34]
I mean like sure, you could do it that
way. That's not what I asked for. I need
to verify this. So
I got to go over here. Like what does a
stateless
class look like in Python? Can it be a
class with static methods?
Okay, cuz that's what I was asking for.
Yeah, okay. So look.
I don't It did not do what I wanted. I
mean close. So
Okay. We'll go all the way down here.
You know, I wanted a stateless class.
That is a class
with static functions.
Right? So you didn't uh
And I noticed
some of the functions were handling
partition logic.
Is that something that should really
be part of the partitions
uh py?
Right? So that's something I'm noticing
as we are shaping that code.
And so we're going to give that a moment
to shuffle those things around.
Now, is it thinking about that or is it
just shoving things over there? Index by
agent for partitions. Sure.
Build initial messages. Again, is that
for partition? Is it actually asking
that question? Does it belong over there
or is it just that it's handling
partition data?
Because it moved it and it didn't
actually question whether it goes there
or not.
But anyway, we'll go over to here and
we'll take a look of what's changed.
What's it still working?

[01:48:44]
It's now this is looking a lot better.
Cuz now we can see what is going in,
what's going out, right?
And so we have all these steps.
So we have call.
So create a message.
Log reasoning.
Again, like it does this logging stuff
belong with the logger?
Handle screening agent.
Handle evaluation coverage. Handle
files. Handle submit final.
Process tool calls.
Run. Did they put these at the bottom?
They did. Sometimes people put these at
the top or sometimes they put at the
bottom, but like the one that obviously
is the big one is this one here. And so
the idea is that we should be able to
easily see what it's doing. So we have
generate partitions, partitions.
Validate overlap. Index agents, right?
And so this should be self-documenting
as you read it. We go down here. We call
the coordinator. We do the log
reasoning.
Why are these functions? Are these just
loose functions?
They are. Well, no, they're part of the
partition. And so I would go over to
here and I would say, you know, give the
give the partitions.py
the partitions.py
like
all of our lib directory Now I'll say
our partitions.py
should be a stateless class.
I So a class with static functions.
Please update. And that's just the way I
prefer it, okay? I like to group them

[01:50:42]
into domain. I don't like having loose
functions where we don't know where
they're coming from and who who respects
them or owns them.
Um people in the data space are very
much used to just randomly importing a
bunch of stuff, so they have a less
sensitivity to to that kind of thing,
but to me as a very professional
developer I I want to see where that
stuff is coming from. We still have some
of our if else stuff here. And notice in
here like these again, these should be
functions.
Right? All they're all they're doing is
calling these things, but still I want
these as functions.
If there's an if else statement in here,
especially in our main loop, that's what
it should be. We have a range of 1 to
31, so that's kind of defining how many
steps it can take. Um I would rather
that uplifted as a variable.
But we're not going to go too crazy on
this. I just want to get it in enough
shape here. And mostly just to show you
like what good code looks like. Um and
what you should be doing before you move
on stuff. You might say, "Well, Andrew,
why like this is more work to read?"
Yeah, but if if you want to write test
code for this then you have an input and
an output and you know exactly what to
mock going in there and out of there.
The only thing that I would also change
is like if these are complex um
objects I'd want them to be dumber and
only pass in really dumb data so that we
could mock it a lot easier. And this is
pain points if you've spent a lot of

[01:51:58]
time writing uh code. And you might say,
"Well, you know, the AI can write the
test code for us." But that doesn't make
it good test reliable test and and
you'll only know that by uh writing that
stuff. But we'll go over here. We'll
take a look at our partitions.
And so that is fine. There's still lots
of little improvements to be made like
I'm looking at like why is that like
that? I don't like hard-coded stuff like
that. Um there's just a bunch of little
things. But I'll just say we'll move the
coordinator over. So uh the coordinator
uh can be in its
uh coordinator class
should be uh in
a its own file
in the lib directory.
And we'll move that over there. That'll
be the last thing we do here.
and then what we will do is we'll just
run it, make sure it still works.
And then we'll call this, you know
done-ish, right? But again, you know, if
this was something that I would want to
put in production, I would take the time
and fine-tune it. I would take the time
and fine-tune it and and because that's
about getting um
uh the word I'm looking for is um
uh technical ownership, right? That you
have ownership of the code and and you
know exactly what it's doing. When you
shape it like that, then you have a
better sense of it. So now the
coordinator is over there. I want to
just run it to make sure it works. So
I'm going to CD into the coordinator
refactor and we're going to go ahead and

[01:53:22]
run python. or python.main.py.
Okay? So we're going to run that and we
will take a look and hopefully it still
works.
There we go.
I wonder if it's going to make the log
We do get our logs. Excellent.
Coordinator.log. Okay, and see that's
what I meant when I said I wanted it to
be nice and
uh and whatever. I might even suggest
like I'd probably prefer it to log out
JSON structure because then we could
parse that information.
yeah, I think I would that's what I
would prefer especially like if you're
data-driven and you have JSON L data as
logs, it's super super useful.
Um so instead of having like coordinator
and delegate um I would probably just
have JSON objects and then I could parse
it and ingest it into something else.
But again, these are little tricks that
you learn building applications of all
kinds. Um but the point is that it is
running. We just want to see it to
completion and then we will call this
done and then we will move on because
the next section of stuff we are looking
at is um stuff that I feel like agent
SDK is going to be uh very useful for.
Um they'll all have to decide on that.
And so it did run. Worked great. The
only thing that I'd probably ask it to
do, which it's not doing right now is
that I would have it dump the coverage
report into its own file. So that'll be
the last thing that we do here.
Okay, and so I'm going to go here.
Cuz that would actually make it useful,

[01:54:46]
right? So I'm going to go and just say
um you know, for my
coordinator refactor
uh it currently generates
it generates
a coverage report
in the logs but it really should be
outputting
outputting um uh the a a report
timestamped
uh in a reports directory
um and formatted nicely
for uh human to read.
And so that's the last thing I would
absolutely say we need to do. I just
realized that that's a little bit um
gross on how it currently is.
Uh and we never looked at our data, but
yeah, we have our job posting and stuff.
And this is we could enrich these later,
but they're fine.
There's really no new data here.
Uh we could have made a research that
would grab job postings and make it for
us. Not that anyone really should care
about job postings anymore because
agents are just
going at it, but we'll wait for this to
finish. Okay? And then we might run this
one more time.
Okay, there we go. And so um it says
it's there. The other thing is that I
don't think we're logging uh usage.
So that would be nice to be able to log
that information out. But again, these
might be things we get for free when we
use the agent SDK.
So I'm not exactly sure. Um and so now
that is done, I'm going to go ahead and
run this one more time. Clear.

[01:56:16]
I have no idea how many um credits I'm
burning. Like again, I haven't hit my I
have like $5 or whatever. I haven't hit
it yet and Bako's not going to get mad
if I load up another $5. So so far it is
not a pain problem. People don't know,
Bako is the other Andrew, Andrew B. I'm
Andrew B. And so we call him Bako so
it's not confusing. He's definitely a
real person. He's not um an agent. Or is
he? We don't know. No one ever sees him.
Uh so we're going to run this again. I'm
going to pause here and then I just want
to confirm the reports are there. But
again, you can just see my thoughts of
like what would be good to do. Okay?
We still have the coverage report being
logged here, which I don't like, but
that's fine. As long as we got a I
didn't we didn't tell tell it to not do
that there. But we'll go here and then
here is our report. We can go ahead and
view it over like this.
And so there is our final coverage
assessment.
Um I really don't like how long it's
written this stuff. Like if you were
human, would you want to read this much
information? Probably not. Or you'd want
it summarized in a different way, but we
never gave it a coverage report
template, so that's fine. We will
consider this done. We'll say get add
all, get commit refactor.
But that wasn't bad for a quick
refactor. Still lots of work to be done
there, right? Um I'll see you in the
next one. Ciao ciao.
Hey folks, it's Andrew. We're back and
it's time for us to port our coordinator

[01:57:36]
application over to agent SDK. And the
reason why is that we're going to be
getting into um
uh specific agent SDK um
arguments and if we want to know how
they work, we need to have an example
over there. And I think we should just
continue this project forward and I
think it's not a bad idea. So what we
are going to do um
is we're going to call this uh port to
to agent
SDK.
Okay? And so what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to grab the contents of all
this. Not the logs. We don't need the
logs or the reports. But we will grab
this, this, this, this, this, and this.
Right click copy. We'll go down over to
our port to agent SDK. We will paste
this stuff in.
And we're are going to
let her rip and see if it will
allow us to port it over in one go here.
So
I need to port the my code base
uh of Anthropic SDK based on uh for my
agent that uses directly
the Anthropic
SDK to use
Claude agent SDK
for this folder.
Port SDK.
And so we're going to ask it to go ahead
and do that. That's a big thing. Again,
we probably should have put it in a plan
mode and ask it what it can do.
But I'm just going to go off of the
races and do that. And if it works, we
will explore it and

[01:59:14]
we'll have time to look at the code base
quite a bit as we walk through other
features, okay?
All right, let's take a look here and
So we have the run updated. I'm not sure
why it did that. It's not really that
big of a deal.
We removed the async Anthropic and
coordinator. These are now internal to
the coordinator. Sure.
It has a complete rewrite. I was
expecting that.
That I assume that would be the largest
rewrite for us.
And I guess all those are unchanged.
That's really interesting. And then we
need to do a
a update here. I mean, you know,
you know, can you make the
requirements.txt for me?
Cuz that's what it should have done. But
I we never copied it from a prior one.
That's probably why.
Yeah, we didn't. So let's go take a look
at the the major changes. So we'll look
at the main.py. And
here we can see async Anthropic. Oh, so
there's where it's different. Default
async client. That's why there was a
change there. This is the new one,
There we go. Okay.
And so this more or less looks the same.
But we'll go into our coordinator
directory here.
And let's see if we can
make the difference here.
Okay. So I'm going to do is scroll up
here. What I might do,
just so that we can really clearly see
the difference,

[02:00:50]
we might refactor a smaller one because
it's very hard to see the changes. They
don't even show us the code changes
here, right? Um
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to make another repo.
Make another folder here. Let's see.
Port
Anthropic uh port to agent SDK small.
And the reason I want to do that again
is to really clearly see the difference.
And so I'm trying to think of one that
we were doing before, like narrow task
decomposition.
Yeah, where we have this one. This one's
a lot simpler, right?
And we actually might want to go one
step before that where we are using tool
use.
Could be decision-making, model-driven,
right? So this one here
is a very simple one with multiple
tools. So what we're we'll do is we'll
copy this
over here. And then I go into this
directory just so we can clearly see
the difference. And then also maybe just
have another one that we can work on.
Though I don't really like this use case
per se. Okay. And so
I'm going to go and say, "Okay, great.
Can we Can we convert the code for port
uh SDK small?"
over to agent SDK. Again, we haven't
tested if these actually work. Hopefully
it knows Claude agent SDK, not just some
generic one. Um but anyway, I think it
knows. I hope it knows. We'll wait here
a moment, okay? All right, so we have
the refactor already done for this one.

[02:02:31]
Didn't take too long. Let's see what
it's changed. So the imports are
different.
Yeah, it is using Anthropic, the correct
No, no, no, no, no. It Yeah, it is.
Okay, here it is. So here it is and
here instead of handling tools here, we
have a decorator.
And then the functions are probably
defined a particular way. See this whole
big thing is probably gone. Yep. And so
we have decorators on top of our
functions making this code a lot
smaller.
Um the call is a bit different. So
that's one thing.
we are creating the SDK MCP server to
pass the tools over. So that is another
thing that's changing.
I mean, we have new modes and we're
setting our MCP server
with our tooling in it.
Um okay. So basically we basically have
an internal internal MCP. That's really
interesting they make that with super
super easy.
And this call is a little bit different.
So basically the big thing that we're
seeing is that tool use.
Um so let's go back to our larger
refactor. And I want to take a look at
And so that tool.json, do we even need
that anymore? Does that even make any
sense? So what we'll do is go back over
Cuz now we know what was refactored,
right? And we'll say,
"Do we even need
the tools.json
anymore? And shouldn't we
be using the decorator?"

[02:04:24]
for port to
agent SDK
base for Claude
agent SDK.
And I imagine that you can probably pass
in that JSON tools cuz it's it's doing
it. No, we don't we don't know if it
actually works or not. Um
Like we go here, tools.json.
Like I don't see it loaded in here.
Maybe it's getting loaded in the main.
It is refactoring probably right now, so
we wouldn't even know.
But we'll see what it says here.
Cuz we do have tool right here, right?
So it is. It's right here.
So maybe it just has to delete it out.
But if the tool is here, then why isn't
that defined? Or does it have to sit in
the same place?
Right? So we have this one here. Is this
just a repeat?
And like look at all this inline stuff,
eh?
Object maybe pass rationals key strings.
That's the structure that we actually
wanted from before.
And so here all three tool decorators
are now using the simple peram.
Okay, but like does the coordinator
still have them in here?
Do we have to have
the tools in
the coordinator
.py or can they actually they live
in the
tools directory
as separate functions?
Or it doesn't work because
tight coupling

[02:06:30]
of the decorator.
Which is this part here. It might be the
reason why they can't do that. And I
mean, hopefully it knows what last
directory we're in.
Is it more than one? But
we'll ask that question. And you know,
this is what I'm trying to figure out.
Let's see what it says here. So the key
insight tools of decorator runs at call
time, not import time. So you can apply
it inside the factory function that
captures state via normal closures.
Okay. Well,
speak English to me here.
Can we move it or not?
Coordinator class.
Tools. Screening agent.
Look look, I'm trying to keep my stuff
lean here, folks.
Did it move it out?
Did it even tell me that it moved it
out?
So here coordinator state, make
coordinator. So it did move it out from
I don't like how they're make
coordinator tools.
Okay. And then we have coordinator
state.
All right. Okay, I see. So they they
have a state file separately for the I
mean, state wouldn't belong in tools,
now would it?
So that doesn't make any sense.
Unless it's coming from that file. Maybe
it it's part of it. That's why. Okay.
And so we go over to here.
And we have make coordinator tools. Oh,
and they do have it in here. Okay, so
they were able to move it out.

[02:08:10]
And so here we have
our multiple tools. Okay. And so to me,
that's what I would like it to be.
So I'm going to go ahead and we're going
to stop this. And we're going to CD into
the port to agent SDK. And I just want
to make sure that this still works.
So we'll go ahead and say main.python.
dot
We have main
or main. Python. I got it backwards.
Python main.
Whatever. Whoops.
And I just want to make sure that it
still runs. Because we've changed a lot
of code or at least
one large file to another framework.
It's logging.
We'll pause here and see the end result,
but I'm pretty certain that it's going
to work.
Okay, so it ran without issue and we are
in good shape. Um
Yeah, so we are set up and the question
will be like, you know, do we use this
to test out all the agency decay stuff
or do we come back to this project? We
will see, but at least we made it to
this point and I think the key takeaway
here is the fact that uh the tool use
call got easier and it's setting up an
MCP server. Okay, so literally it's an
internal NPC server.
Um and so clearly
uh Entropic is obviously making that a
priority tool. But anyway,
there we go and we will move on from
that, okay? Ciao ciao.
